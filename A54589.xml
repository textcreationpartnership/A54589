            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a matter of higheſt concernment unto the ſouls of men, to have a ſpecial acquaintance with the Covenant of Grace, the great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which all ſpiritual and eternal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are holden by, and the way and means wherein they have their convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or are derived to them.</p>
            <p>There are many uſeful Treatiſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready extant on this ſubject; but ſtill there are ſome weighty points refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to it as with Jeſus Chriſt, and eſpecially concerning the Old mount
<pb facs="tcp:48981:3"/>
               <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant and alſo the New, which have need of farther clearing, for the unfolding of many Scriptures, the eſtabliſhing the faith and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the comfort of Chriſtians. If it might be the fruit of my preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to contribute any thing this way, or to give light into thoſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous myſteries ſo as God might be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured thereby, I ſhould have my aim.</p>
            <p>In order to the further opening of ſome matters inſiſted on in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, I ſhall add that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>As the Covenant of Works was made with the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and all his ſeed in him, promiſing preſervation in life, upon condition of mans own perfect obedience to the will of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
            <p>So, the Covenant of Grace, was made with Jeſus Chriſt (not meerly as God, but as to be incarnate, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be Mediator) as a ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and with a Goſpel ſeed in him, promiſing all ſpiritual bleſſings, even
<pb facs="tcp:48981:3"/>
eternal life and ſalvation upon the condition or conſideration of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the curſe, and yielding perfect obedience to the Law on their behalf, <hi>Iſai. 53. 10, 11. Rom. 5. 6. to the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this large ſenſe, it compriſeth that between the Father and the Son for our redemption which was full of grace, and did flow from the free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God to poor ſinners, <hi>2 Tim. 1. 9. Tit. 1. 2.</hi> as well as that to or with us, <hi>viz.</hi> the New Covenant, for the application of what is promiſed thereupon, which ſome ſpeak of, as if it only were the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>Thus its conſtitution was from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Tit. 1. 2.</hi> though its revelation was in time to <hi>Adam, Abraham, David,</hi> &amp;c. Gen. 3. 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now, that being the condition of the Covenant of Grace, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law ſhould be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or all the demands of it as to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and penalty anſwered by Jeſus Chriſt; hence it was neceſſary that there ſhould be ſome means for his
<pb facs="tcp:48981:4"/>
coming actually under our very obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: to that end, the Lord in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdom made a revival or repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the Covenant of works as to the ſubſtance of it (with a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent) in the Covenant at Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai</hi> (which did run upon Do and Live, <hi>Gal. 3. 10, 12.)</hi> not that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould have eternal life, by their own doing; but that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the very Law that we were obliged by, <hi>Gal. 4. 4.</hi> Not meerly to make a valuable ſatisfaction by ſomething in lieu of it (for his taking our nature, and making interceſſion or other works of his, being of infinite merit and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lùe, might then have ſerved the turn without his ſufferings) but as that word, <hi>Gen. 2. 17.</hi> required, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the very curſe, and to fulfil the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry righteouſneſs of it in our ſtead, which he did accordingly, and herein eſpecially conſiſteth our redemption. <hi>Gal. 3. 12. Gal. 4. 4, 5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fulfillng the Old and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the New Covenant are the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate effects of his death. He ſtood
<pb facs="tcp:48981:4"/>
therein as the Mediator not of the Old, but of the New Teſtament, <hi>Heb. 9. 15.</hi> therefore he died, not meerly to procure a New Covenant, or that God might with honour deal with men upon new terms, but to make good the terms or conditions of the New.</p>
            <p>The Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant (with reference to the matter of it) may be ſaid to expreſs the Legal Condition of the Covenant of Grace, as to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by Jeſus Chriſt; even as the New Covenant holdeth forth the bleſſings promiſed unto us that condition being performed by him. Theſe are matters ſo diſtinct, as I hope none will take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that I (as I have explained my ſelf) ſpeak of the Old and New as two diſtinct Covenants when compared each with other, as <hi>Gal. 4. 24. Heb. 8.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing I do not aſſert, that at <hi>Sinai</hi> to be a Covenant of works for eternal life to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> upon their obedience to it, as ſome would have it, rather its reference is wholly to that of grace, though it be not the whole of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48981:5"/>
Neither do I aſſert two Covenants of Grace or ways of ſalvation for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance diſtinct. But whereas it is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally judged that the Old is one and the ſame with the New, differing from it only in ſome circumſtances and accidents, as rigorous exaction of duty by fear, terror, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I on the other hand think that ſpiritual bleſſings were diſpenſed out by the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and though <hi>Iſraels</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Moral Law, was on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account, a fruit of holineſs and ſanctification, yet as the ſame obedience had relation to the Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, ſo it uſhered in only temporals to them: even as a child oweth obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Father by a natural obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but if a Father ſhould promiſe an eſtate upon ſome acts of the ſame obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, then they would be cloathed with a double reſpect, or have a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſe; ſo here.</p>
            <p>The Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant being thus opened, many Scriptures will be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it will be diſcovered, what thoſe works of the Law are, which we are ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="tcp:48981:5"/>
denied to have juſtification by: <hi>viz.</hi> All works performed by our ſelves as the leaſt of a righteouſneſs unto juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (or which cometh to the ſame) as a condition giving right and title to Salvation. <hi>Act. 15. 1. Rom. 9. 30, 31, 32. Phil. 3. 9.</hi> It is only the Obedience of Jeſus Chriſt to the Law that availeth to theſe ends. The Apoſtle induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly proveth, that men have not ſuch eternal mercies by their own works, morla or ceremonial either without or in conjunction with Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom. 3. 20. &amp; 9. 3. Gal. 3. 11, 21. Gal. 5. 4.</hi> the ſeeking to be juſtified or ſaved thereby is oppoſite unto true ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whence diſcourſes thereof are often interwoven in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians.</hi> It's true, the very works of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> are moſt particularly oppoſed, becauſe the controverſie of that day with the Jews and Judaizing profeſſors of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was concerning theſe: yet if men give any other works the ſame place and office, by acting upon a legal ground, they become as works of the
<pb facs="tcp:48981:6"/>
Law, and the Apoſtles arguments are equally forcible againſt them.</p>
            <p>For, he thus reaſoneth, That can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a juſtifying righteouſneſs in our preſent fallen eſtate, 1. Which is not perfect, for the leaſt ſin is enough to condemn, <hi>Rom. 3. 20. Gal. 3. 10.</hi> Nor, 2. which is our own, of our own working out, <hi>Rom. 10. 3, 5.</hi> Nor, 3. Which leaves any place for boaſting, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 9. Rom. 4. 2.</hi> Nor, 4. which is oppoſite unto grace, <hi>Rom. 4. 4.</hi> And upon theſe accounts, all Evangelical Works are excluded out of Juſtification, for they are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they are our own ſubjectively; they would leave room for ſome boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if acceptance to life were upon theſe, ſeeing it ſhould be by our gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unto God: alſo the way were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to grace, for if the condition were never ſo ſmall, yet being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the reward might be claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon our act, and ſo would be of debt, not of Goſpel-grace; <hi>Rom. 4. 4.</hi> The works of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter converſion are excluded out of
<pb facs="tcp:48981:6"/>
juſtification, <hi>verſ. 2, 3, 6.</hi> which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth, that although Evangelical obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience kept in its due place, doth not derogate from the grace of God, yet it doth, and is oppoſite to it, if introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into juſtification. So that [Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-grace] doth not conſiſt in a bare abatement of the rigor of the Law, nor in making a bargain with us (for the ſake of Chriſt) to accept of our faith, repentance and ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, inſtead of that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: but it ſtandeth, in excuſing us from a perſonal performance of that righteouſneſs which is the condition of life and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Jeſus Chriſt to anſwer the Law in our ſtead. For, the grand diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Law and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is, the one juſtifieth by our own, the other by anothers righteouſneſs. If man himſelf be the Doer for life, that is the righteouſneſs of the Law, which ſaith, <hi>Rom. 10. 5.</hi> the man that doth them ſhall live in them. In oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it, that of the Goſpel is called [the righteouſneſs of faith] <hi>verſ. 6.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48981:7"/>
and of God, <hi>verſ. 3.</hi> becauſe it is to be ſought out of our ſelves, in another, in the free promiſe; and that which we are the ſubjects of is to be diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, <hi>Phil. 3. 9. Rom. 10. 3.</hi> The aſſerting it to be by any of our perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal performances, giveth them the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place of works in the Covenant of Works, which is anti-evangelical and introduceth ſome merits as well as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect works would have done. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enabled by grace to them doth not hinder meriting, any more than (as one ſaith) my furniſhing a man with my tools to work with, hinders his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a reward. All ability that <hi>Adam</hi> had in innocency was from the favour of God, and what he was to do was duty. Faith it ſelf is not the leaſt of that righteouſneſs; it is an act of obedience, but as ſuch it is not ſaid to juſtifie, nor as it worketh by love, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it doth ſo work, <hi>Gal. 5. 6.</hi> Nor as a condition of life (as I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where manifeſted) but only as a means for the applying Chriſt and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; much leſs can any works of
<pb facs="tcp:48981:7"/>
ours be a part thereof. The new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture availeth to being crucified to the world, <hi>Gal. 6. 14, 15. i. e.</hi> as a means, but it is not ſaid that it avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to juſtification.</p>
            <p>To juſtifie, is, to declare a perſon to be righteous; the true God cannot paſs a falſe ſentence, therefore we cannot have juſtification without having a righteouſneſs: this cannot conſiſt in any act of ours as faith, repentance or obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as is already manifeſted; therefore it muſt be of anothers working out, the very righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom. 5. 18, 19. 1 Cor. 1. 30.</hi> And if his obedience (being to the Law) may be called a legal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet as the ſame is applied by faith, it is to us an evangelical righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. All the queſtion then is, whether evangelical works are not of the ſame uſe in juſtification that faith is of? have they not the ſame place and office there, that faith hath? I anſwer negatively, they have not; for often we read of the righteouſneſs of faith, never of the righteouſneſs of love in
<pb facs="tcp:48981:8"/>
that buſineſs. We are ſaid to be juſtified by faith, not (in the ſame ſenſe) to be juſtified by love or works.</p>
            <p>It's true, there is a neceſſity of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical works to teſtifie our faith, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and thankfulneſs to God, but they are required, not as conditions, but as effects and declarations of our juſtification. Things are ſaid to be done, when they are manifeſted, as, <hi>Rom. 3. 7. &amp; 4. 15.</hi> A tree is known by the fruits. And thus not only open acts, but thoſe that are ſecret (when regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar) have an aptitude to evidence faith, and that a perſon is juſtified, even when they are not actually ſeen. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of being juſtified before God by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving or applying the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt in the free promiſe, this is only by faith. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh of being juſtified by manifeſting to a mans ſelf or others that it is applied, this is by Evangelical works, and not by faith only. Thus by offering up <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the perſon of <hi>Abraham</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratively juſtified, as it did ſhew his
<pb facs="tcp:48981:8"/>
faith to be true, <hi>verſ. 18. (Gen. 22. 12.)</hi> and not his working, but his believing is ſaid to be imputed to righteouſneſs, <hi>Jam. 2. 23.</hi> if this be juſtification in the ſenſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> yet it is by faith [and he was called the friend of God] there is juſtification declared by works, as God acted kindly towards him, ſo he acted in a friendly way towards God. He is a vain man that content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf with a faith that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a bare aſſent to ſome propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of truth without the power of them upon his heart, <hi>verſ. 14, 19, 20.</hi> That is a dead faith, which doth not profit, is not attended with ſalvation which remaineth without works, <hi>verſ. 17, 20, 26.</hi> therefore it is not the ſame true faith which any are juſtified by, but another thing. That unfruitful faith which is blamed here, certainly was as far from juſtifying them as it was from ſaving them, and ſo is not the faith which <hi>Paul</hi> inſiſteth upon, for by that men were juſtified, and that in order before works, for they cannot be performed in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
<pb facs="tcp:48981:9"/>
though they certainly follow: but the juſtification and faith which they are put upon and called to declare by works, theſe are of a Goſpel ſtamp.</p>
            <p>The Lord Jeſus having fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Law as the condition of the New-Teſtament, hence it becometh abſolute to us. If improperly a duty, a way, or means to the enjoyment of ſome bleſſings of it, be called a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I contend not. But a Condition properly is more than a <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> it is a cauſe that hath a moral efficiency in it; for the fulfilling of it is that which giveth right, and upon which a man hath a title to what is promiſed, and without it none; and ſo it is a moral efficient cauſe of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the good promiſed in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Faith and repentance are great duties; but nothing performed by us can be ſuch a cauſe or condition in the New Covenant.</p>
            <p>There is Abſoluteneſs, 1. In the form of the New Covenant. 2. In the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al admiſſion into it. 3. In the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of thoſe under it from the curſe of
<pb facs="tcp:48981:9"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:48981:10"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:48981:10"/>
the Old, and in their participation of the bleſſings of the New.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Wherever the form of the New Teſtament is given forth, it is in an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute way [I will, and ye ſhall]. <hi>Heb. 10. 16, 17. Heb. 8. 8.</hi> to the end. He inſiſteth upon it that now <hi>Jerem. 31. 31, 32.</hi> was made good, and this purpoſely to draw off the Hebrews from the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which they did too much take up in, and to put them upon looking unto the New. Other Scriptures may diſcover what is our duty before and after being actually intereſted in the bleſſings of it; but the nature of the Covenant is moſt fully expreſſed here in theſe Texts, which ſpeak of the great matters or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes contained in it, of the Mediator and ſubjects of it. The tenure thereof muſt be fetched from theſe places where the Covenant is purpoſely inſiſted upon, rather than from others, where only one promiſe is named, and it not ſo much as mentioned. And here, it is not call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a purpoſe or prophecie, but a Covenant or rather Teſtament, and is ſo abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held forth, as God undertaketh all.
<pb facs="tcp:48981:11"/>
He promiſeth as well that they ſhall be his people, as that he will be their God He promiſeth not only that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their ſins and iniquities no more, but alſo that he will write hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> plainly is, to expreſs the work of God what he will do for them, how he with furniſh and capacitate them to diſcharge it towards him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The actual admiſſion of all that Jeſus Chriſt ſtood for, into the New Covenant, or the bringing them under it is abſolutely determined: he had an abſolute aſſurance that his undertaking ſhould take effect on all thoſe that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned therein, <hi>Iſai. 53. 10, 11.</hi> He ſhall ſee his ſeed; all that he travelled
<pb facs="tcp:48981:11"/>
for, and therefore they muſt be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally brought into Covenant with him. There was no condition that his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had dependence upon, or upon which it was to be accepted for ſuch ſouls, otherwiſe not. He did not ſuffer at any ſuch uncertainty, but for thoſe which were aſſuredly to become the heirs of promiſe.</p>
            <p>Yea, the making Covenant with us, is challenged by the Lord as his work, <hi>Iſai. 53. 3.</hi> &amp; 61. 8. I will make or cut an everlaſting Covenant with you, ſo <hi>Jer. 31. 31, 32. Jer. 22. 40. Ezek. 16. 8. Heb. 8. 10.</hi> God hath underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to bring under the promiſe, and make an application of it. Attendance upon means is duty, but it is not ſaid, that men do make the Covenant with God or bring themſelves into it by an act of theirs, but God maketh it with them, they do but take hold of Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Iſai. 56. 4, 6.</hi> The will of God is not determined by any act of man. When God will work who ſhall lett him? what he undertaketh ſhall be abſolutely accompliſhed; hence as thoſe under the
<pb facs="tcp:48981:12"/>
Old Covenant who were to be redeemed are repreſented under the name of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo alſo are thoſe under the New to whom all is to be applied; the ſame are the ſubjects of both.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe that are actually in Covenant have an abſolute freedom from the curſe of the Old, and a like Promiſe of the bleſſings of the New. Jeſus Chriſt hath not only ſuſpended, but redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us, <hi>Gal. 3. 13.</hi> Hence we are ſaid not to be under the Law and to be dead to it, <hi>Rom. 6. 14. &amp; 7. 4. Gal. 2. 19.</hi> Chriſtians then have not only a conditional freedom from the curſe of the Law in this life, but ſuch as is abſolute; and if they ſhould believe themſelves to be under it, they ſhould believe a lie. <hi>Rom. 8. 1.</hi> Yet Divine threatnings are of great uſe, not only to the unregenerate, but even to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, to ſtrike them into a filial fear, ſo as to deter them from ſin, which hath ſuch puniſhment annexed to it, and this when they ſee themſelves ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from it; even as an ingenuous
<pb facs="tcp:48981:12"/>
Child will be afraid upon hearing his father threaten another for a fault and will beware of committing it. The non-elect are formally under the curſe of the Law and vindictive Juſtice. The Elect before converſion, are not only materially under it, but the Laws ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation is againſt them. Believers are ſo freed from it, as their ſickneſſes, death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are but materially the ſame mentioned in the curſe, and turned into bleſſings to them.</p>
            <p>Alſo all the Promiſes of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant are abſolute to all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. <hi>Heb. 8. 6, &amp;c.</hi> No act of ours induceth an obligation upon God to vouchſafe ſalvation to us. That great bleſſing of the Covenant, Juſtification, is by faith, not ſaid to be by it as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the ſame may be ſaid of other bleſſings thereof; yet I deny not but figuratively that may be aſcribed to faith which belongeth to Jeſus Chriſt alone. The abſoluteneſs of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is not attended with any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as that then man is at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but God is not: for, ſuch as are yet
<pb facs="tcp:48981:13"/>
out of Covenant, or want a perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the bleſſings of it, even all men are under a Divine Law, and an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obedience, elſe they could not be charged with ſin, as they are, <hi>Rom. 3. 23. &amp; 5. 12.</hi> where there is no Law there is no tranſgreſſion, ſeeing ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the Law. <hi>1 Joh. 3. 4.</hi> So then, the obligation unto duty doth not ariſe meerly from entring or coming into Covenant; and that is ſo far from taking off the tie that it ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraddeth ſtrength to it; but no man is at liberty, whether he be in or out of Covenant.</p>
            <p>As to the way of the Lords entring into Covenant with men, it is thus:</p>
            <p>He by his Spirit in the Goſpel reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and giveth Jeſus Chriſt (for he is the firſt ſaving gift) and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are vouchſafed in and with him. <hi>Coloſſ. 2. 6. 1 Joh. 5. 12. Rom. 8. 32. Eph. 3. 6. 2 Cor. 1. 30. 2 Pet. 1. 4.</hi> The ſame New Covenant or Teſtament hath various effects.</p>
            <p>As the Spirit worketh effectually by the Promiſe of it upon the ſouls of men,
<pb facs="tcp:48981:13"/>
ſo it is a Covenant of life and grace to them: it is by the New-Teſtament that the Lord ſaith to any ſouls live, and that firſt grace is wrought in them; <hi>Ezek. 16. 8. &amp; 36. 26. Heb. 8. 10. 2 Cor. 3. 6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Lord by giving and promulging the Promiſes, obligeth or putteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under engagements to make them good to men, ſo it is a Covenant to or with them, becauſe they obtain perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſt therein ſo as to have a ground to claim many priviledges thereof: thus often the Covenant was renewed with <hi>Abraham</hi> after his being in it.</p>
            <p>As by the ſame Covenant or Promiſe the Lord obligeth himſelf to all acts of Communion, and expreſſions of love, and kindneſs ſuitable to or that can be expected in a conjugal relation, ſo it is a Marriage Covenant with them: the ſame inſtant they are enabled to conſent by faith <hi>(Heb. 8. 10. Joh. 1. 12.)</hi> to receive and enjoy the bleſſings promiſed as a neceſſary fruit and effect of the Covenant. It is promiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:48981:14"/>
that they ſhall be his people, they ſhall reſign up themſelves to the Lord. He hath undertaken that one <hi>(i. e.</hi> one by one) ſhall ſay, I am the Lords, <hi>Iſai. 44. 3, 5.</hi> A conſent is promiſed by the Lords as well as any other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So that our engaging our ſelves to God (or Covenanting with him) is not conſtitutive of the Covenant of grace, but executive, namely that which is produced in the execution of it, and may often be repeated or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by diſtinct engagings. God dealing with men as reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that act out of judgement and their own choice, urgeth duty (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, repenting, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the advantage of coming up to it [All that believe ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved] and the danger of neglecting it, ſuch [ſhall be damned] as <hi>Mark 16 16. Rom. 10. 9. Rev. 3. 20.</hi> Such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral propoſitions do not expreſs the full tenure of the Covenant, but only are means towards the execution of it for, the invitations extend to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Matth. 28. 19. Mark. 16. 15.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48981:14"/>
(ſince the death of Chriſt not before, <hi>Pſal. 147. 19, 20.)</hi> Whereas the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is only with the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, <hi>Heb. 8. 8.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall add no more at preſent to this, but that my deſign in all is, the right ſtating evangelical duty, and the aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doctrine of free grace, which as it is the moſt Chriſt-exalting, ſo it is the moſt ſin-mortifying, ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbling and abaſing, and ſelf-empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doctrine: it is not the Law of works, but of faith that excludeth boaſting. <hi>Coloſſ. 1. 18, 19. Rom. 6. 1, 14. Tit. 2. 11, 12. Rom. 3. 27.</hi>

            <p>THE enſuing Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth a ſober endeavour for the declaration and true ſtating of the nature and difference of the two Covenants of Works and of Grace. A ſubject this is which, by reaſon of the weight and uſe of it in the whole buſineſs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Obedience, hath been attempted by many, and wherein, by reaſon of the difficulty of it, in conjunction with their own Prejudices, not a few have miſcarried. Neither do I know of any who have yet handled it with that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perſpicuity as to ſhut up the way unto the diligence of others in the inveſtigation and declaration of the
<pb facs="tcp:48981:16"/>
Truth, or to render Labour in the ſame kind either uſeleſs or ſuperfluous. The ſtores of heavenly wiſdom, grace and truth which are treaſured up in the Divine Revelations concerning Gods Covenants, are far from being fully exhauſted or drawn forth by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of any in this kind, although very many have already brought to light excellent and uſeful inſtructions in the mind of God and the duty of them who do believe. But the thing it ſelf is ſo excellent, the myſtery of it ſo great, the declaration of it in the Scripture ſo extenſive and diffuſed throughout the whole body of it from the firſt to the laſt, as alſo in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment unto the whole courſe of our faith and obedience, that there is a ſufficient ground whereon to juſtifie a renewed ſearch into the mind of God therein as revealed in his word. There is no doubt, but the greateſt product of Divine Grace, Goodneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, next unto the ſending of the only Son of God to take our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on him, with the direct effect
<pb facs="tcp:48981:16"/>
and conſequence thereof, is this of his entring into Covenant with the Children of men; nor hath any thing a greater tendency unto the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own glory. God might have dealt with mankind in a way of ſoveraignty or meer dominion, as he doth with the remainder of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures here below; but then it muſt be acknowledged that in ſuch a way of rule and procedure there would not have been that evident demonſtration of the divine excellencies, his goodneſs, righteouſneſs and faithfulneſs, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues upon the ſuppoſition of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion to take mankind into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with himſelf. And thence it is that he never did nor ever would treat with any of that race any otherwiſe or on any other terms. Wherefore when the firſt Covenant was broken by the entrance of ſin, God had no other relation unto mankind but that of a ſupreme Ruler and Judge, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them according to the penalty threatned, and eſtabliſhed in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. But as for any advantage in
<pb facs="tcp:48981:17"/>
a way of Love, Peace and Goodneſs there was none remaining until he had made and eſtabliſhed a New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to that end and purpoſe. And this fully diſcovers how great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern there is of the glory of God in the Covenant which he made with us and propoſeth unto us, ſeeing he never declared or intimated any other way of gracious or acceptable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in him; and the effects of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> do iſſue in eternity. Moreover this diſpenſation of God in making a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with our firſt Parents, was the greateſt evidence of the preheminence of that nature where with in time we were endowed, and only demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our being capable to be brought unto eternal enjoyment of him. For God herein admitting us into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with him by a declared Rule of his own Goodneſs and faithfulneſs manifeſted that we were capable of eternal rewards which he propoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in himſelf. And theſe things make the inveſtigation of the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Covenant with God firſt
<pb facs="tcp:48981:17"/>
made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and the terms whereby it was made, both neceſſary and profitable. For although that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is ceaſed by the entrance of ſin, as unto any ſpiritual or eternal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage unto us; yet is it as revealed, ſtill inſtructive in the wiſdom and goodneſs of God, as alſo in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of that ſtate and condition in which we were created, with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that God put upon our Nature, whence directions unto due appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of God, and our ſelves may be taken or derived. But as to the New Covenant which is in and with us in Chriſt, and ſo is comprehenſive of the whole work of his Mediation, it is the only inſtrument of our preſent relation unto God, of his communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of himſelf in a way of Grace, Love and Mercy unto us, of our fixing faith, truſt and affiance on him, and yielding obedience unto him, as alſo of the bringing of our ſouls unto the eternal enjoyment of him. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hereof therefore is neceſſary to every one who thinks it neceſſary for
<pb facs="tcp:48981:18"/>
him to endeavour an acquaintance with God or Chriſt, the preſent ſtate or future condition of his own ſoul. It is therefore doubtleſs a labour worthy of acceptance in any whom God hath given light unto in this Myſterie of his Wiſdom and Grace, and ability for the declaration thereof, to endeavour the direction and inſtruction of others in the Truth and Doctrine hereof, where in all our faith, obedience, preſent comfort, and future happineſs do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. But yet further, beſides theſe two ſolemn ſtated Covenants, the one ſuited unto the preſervation of the ſtate of integrity wherein we were created, and the other to the renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Image of God in us through Jeſus Chriſt which we had loſt by ſin, there is mention in the Scripture of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry particular intervening Covenants that God made with his Church, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſons, at ſeveral ſeaſons. Now whereas they did all partake of the Nature of a Divine Covenant in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, ſo were they emanations from and particular expreſſions or limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:48981:18"/>
of one or other of the two ſolemn Covenants mentioned; for a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of another kind abſolutely, or more Covenants God never made with mankind. But yet under the Old Teſtament, while the wiſdom of God was to be hid in its own myſteries; and not clearly brought forth to light, there was ſuch a mixt diſpenſation, revealing for certain ends, the Notion, Senſe and Power of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and preparative for the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the full revelation and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the latter by Jeſus Chriſt, who was in all things to have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, as that it is not eaſie to diſcern and diſtinguiſh what belongs unto the one in them and what to the other, or from whether of them they are to be denominated. Here therefore is a bleſſed field of ſacred Truth, wherein humble, ſober and judicious perſons may exerciſe themſelves, to the great benefit and advantage of the Church of God. To ſtate I ſay a right the Nature of a Divine Covenant in general, with its Eſſential Properties,
<pb facs="tcp:48981:19"/>
which muſt be in every one that is ſo, to manifeſt the true difference that is between the firſt and ſecond Covenant which God hath made with us, in themſelves, and their Nature, with their different effects and ends, to declare what Properties, Doctrines and Ends of the firſt Covenant or Covenant of Works, with what of the Nature, Power and Efficacy of the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or the Covenant of Grace God brought in and declared in that diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation under the Old Teſtament, wherein there was a mixture of both, though one only eſtabliſhed in power, to manifeſt what there was of Chriſt in the Law, and how the whole power and ſanction of the firſt Covenant was through the Law conferred upon Chriſt, and in him fulfilled and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is a work deſerving the moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent travel of thoſe who are called unto the teaching of the Myſteries of the Goſpel. And in theſe things with ſundry other of an alike importance hath this Worthy Author laboured, if I am not much miſtaken, unto good

               <argument>
                  <p>Of a Covenant in general, and the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the Covenant, into that of Works and of Grace.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE All-wiſe God that he might magnifie his loving kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards miſerable man in vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaving him fellowſhip and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with himſelf, in all ages had this admirable contrivance of dealing with him,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48981:23"/>
not in the way of <hi>prerogative,</hi> but in the way of <hi>Covenant.</hi> When man was in a ſtate of innocency, there was a <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> wherein he put himſelf under engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to him, to continue him in life, if he kept his ſtanding and remained obedient. And alſo man being in a fallen eſtate, he chuſeth ſtill to Coverſe with him in the way of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> not as made with the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> but with Jeſus Chriſt as <hi>a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam,</hi> and with all his Seed in him.</p>
               <p>There are many Scriptures which give clear intimations of ſuch a <hi>federal tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> between God the Father and Jeſus Chriſt the Son, in order to the recovery and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Salvation of Sinners: even where we do not find the very notion or name of it. Thus <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10, 11, 12. There is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual agreement, ſomething to be undergone by Jeſus Chriſt, he is to <hi>make his ſoul an offering for ſin;</hi> ſomething promiſed to him thereupon, <hi>he ſhall ſee his Seed—So Iſa.</hi> 42. 6. Here are the parties Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the Father and the Son, not <hi>men</hi> but <hi>I the Lord</hi> who cannot err in my appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who am faithful and able, even the almighty God, I have called <hi>thee i. e.</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and will <hi>give thee,</hi> the ſpeech is turned and directed to him, <hi>thee,</hi> who art my only beloved Son. Here is the Fathers
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48981:23"/>
deſignation and ſealing of him <hi>(John</hi> 6. 27.) to the mediatorial imployment, promiſing him much upon his undertaking it, and his acceptation of this office and voluntary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Will of the Father in it, <hi>ſo I come to do thy Will,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4, 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 7, 8. <hi>John</hi> 10. 17, 18. And theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amount to or make up a <hi>Covenant</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; for what more can be neceſſary thereunto? Here we have the <hi>matters</hi> or things promiſed <hi>viz.</hi> all that conduce to the compaſſing the great end of ſalvation. Was man under alienation from God? Behold it is promiſed, I will give <hi>for a Covenant;</hi> no way imaginable whereby this wide breach could be made up, but by a <hi>Covenant;</hi> and that of Works being broken, man would not be truſted any more, and therefore now Jeſus Chriſt as a <hi>Surety</hi> undertaketh all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the ending and making up the difference, and the retaking and reſtoring his Seed into Divine favour again for ever, ſo as he is even <hi>the Covenant</hi> of the people, all the condition of life on their part to be performed is found in him. Yea, he hath undertaken the removal of all obſtacles and impediments within, that would hinder their attainment of Covenant mercy, he is given for <hi>a light of the Gentiles,</hi> he taketh away the inward blindneſs that is found with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48981:24"/>
them. No ſinfulneſs or unworthineſs may be a diſcouragement, for behold all is in a way of free grace <hi>[I will give thee—]</hi> Chriſt himſelf the fountain of all is freely given, and the Father is upon the higheſt determination and reſolution for bringing all to effect <hi>I will give thee—.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So there are many promiſes made to Jeſus Chriſt of aſſiſtances and all requiſites to the mannagement of this great work <hi>I will hold thy hand</hi> i. e. will aſſiſt and be thy hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 13. and many promiſes of ſucceſs and of his being Victorious over all his enemies, and having the Heathen for his inheritance, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8, 9. <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. 8. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 14. upon his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: all which plainly argue a <hi>Covenant</hi> between the Father and the Son. It is implied alſo in the aſcribing to him the working out of <hi>redemption;</hi> for, unto that is requiſite an agreement between par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Father promiſeth that upon the payment of ſuch a price by his Son, ſuch Souls ſhould be ranſomed and ſet free; Jeſus Chriſt conſenteth yea payeth it and thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a Redeemer, this amounteth to a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>But in order to the further clearing of this matter, I ſhall conſider a <hi>Covenant</hi> in general, and then its diſtribution into that of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48981:24"/>
Works and that of grace, the intereſt of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in the latter, and alſo the date of it.</p>
               <p>The Word [Covenant] in Hebr. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>Berith,</hi> is taken either <hi>[properly]</hi> for a mutual contract or agreement between two parties, and is differenced from a Law which is without obligation on the Law-giver or Commander, and from a ſingle promiſe, which is without ſtipulation from him to whom it is made. Covenant may be thus taken, when applied to the whole Covenant of grace between the Father and the Son, for therein was ſtipulation.</p>
               <p>Or Covenant is taken <hi>[figuratively]</hi> in Scripture, either for a bare Divine promiſe, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 9, 10. that was with every living Creature, many of which were uncapable of contracting with God, or of making any ſtipulation. So Covenant is taken for a bare ſign or ſeal of it. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. Alſo for a part, as the moral Law which was but a part of the old Covenant, is called the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 28. <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. 9, 11. 15. Thus Covenant and promiſe may be uſed promiſcuouſly, a part for the whole. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17, 18, 19. and thus <hi>figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively</hi> Jeſus Chriſt himſelf is called [the Covenant] <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 6.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48981:25"/>
               <p>The Covenant of God on the behalf of man is two-fold, and is thus diſtinguiſhed.</p>

3. 22. <hi>Leſt he put forth his hand and take alſo of the tree of life and eat and live for ever:</hi> ſuch an act of baniſhment would have been needleſs for prevention, if it had never been intended for ſuch an end to eſtabliſh man in life in caſe he had kept his ſtanding. Some Divine Law or Covenant therefore there muſt be this way. <hi>Some may doubt, whether this was a Covenant of Works, becauſe here is only a threatning of death upon eating the forbidden fruit.</hi> Gen. 2. 17. <hi>upon diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to that one poſitive Law or Command; and perfect obedience unto all moral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, not ſo much as mentioned, nor death threatned to the want of it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>I anſwer,</hi> Man in his firſt Creation was under a Natural obligation to an univerſal compliance with the Will of God: <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 29. <hi>God hath made man [upright];</hi> this rectitude of nature imports an exact conformity to the Divine will, it is oppoſed here to all thoſe inventions, evil devices, new tricks, vain and crooked Counſels, which were the inlets to all iniquity. He was created in the image of God <hi>[Gen.</hi> 1. 27.] which did not conſiſt meerly in the faculties of the ſoul, as underſtanding, will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in gifts of illumination, righteouſneſs, and holineſs. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24. There was an inſcription of the Divine Law upon <hi>Adams</hi>

heart, yea even the Gentiles by nature ſhew the work of the Law written in their hearts <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. although this is exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defaced and obliterated by the fall of man, yet not wholly raced out or extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
               <p>Now there being ſuch original righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a Law of nature that obliged man (as ſoon as created) to all moral obedience, it was needleſs for the Lord (in entring into Covenant with him) to make a repetition of that Law without, which was antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneouſly written in lively Characters, with a deep impreſſion as a Law within.</p>
               <p>All therefore that was neceſſary unto the making or forming of it into a Covenant of Works was, the <hi>Addition</hi> of ſome poſitive Law or Command, as a teſt or tryal of obedience to the whole, and this we find in that Supervenient Command of not eating of the tree of knowledge. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. under the higheſt penalty of <hi>death</hi> it ſelf in caſe of diſobedience. This is the more evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this poſitive percept, was of ſuch a nature and ſo intwiſted with the other, as <hi>Adam</hi> could not fall by tranſgreſſing of it in eating of the forbidden fruit, without a violation or breaking of all the moral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and involving himſelf in all ſin and iniquity thereby. Chriſt himſelf, is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48981:27"/>
giving the ſum of the Law, in theſe two, of due love to God and the neighbour <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37, 38, 39. Now, the tryal of love is by keeping his Commandments. <hi>John</hi> 14. 21, 24. and by eating that fruit, <hi>Adam</hi> tranſgreſſed his Command. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. and gave an evident proof of his want of love to God, and to his neighbour alſo, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by murthering not only himſelf, but all his poſterity with him.</p>
               <p>Yea though it ſeemed a ſmall and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing in it ſelf, yet there was the ſumm of all ſin, in that firſt tranſgreſſion, which the Apoſtle compriſeth in three things. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 16. <hi>All that is in the world, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes and the pride of life.</hi> And <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6. The woman ſaw the tree was <hi>good for food,</hi> in this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a carnal appetite, was the luſt of the fleſh, <hi>and pleaſant to the eyes,</hi> here is the ſeeking to ſatisfie undue deſires, <hi>the luſt of the eyes,</hi> and <hi>to be deſired to make one wiſe,</hi> or as the Serpent ſuggeſted <hi>verſe</hi> 5. <hi>to be as Gods,</hi> that is ambition, or, <hi>pride of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It might be manifeſted, how all or moſt of the Commandments were broken by this act; here was infidelity, not believing the Word of God, and ſeeking to <hi>Deifie</hi> himſelf, againſt the firſt Commandment; <hi>Adam</hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the voice of his wife, yea of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48981:28"/>
Serpent, before the Word of God, againſt the Second, a conferring with Gods enemy about his word (a part of his name) without due zeal for his glory againſt the Third, a not reſting from his own work againſt the Fourth, <hi>Eve</hi> out of her place in eating without her Husbands advice and conſent, againſt the Fifth, a running under a Divine threatning of death to many thouſands, yea millions of men, againſt the Sixth, a giving way to an inordinate ſenſual appetite in eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddem fruit, againſt the Seventh, a taking what was not his own, being reſerved by God, againſt the Eighth, a receiving a falſe accuſation againſt God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5. againſt the Ninth. Uncontentedneſs with the ſtate and Condition God had placed him in, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring to be higher than he ſaw it meer, againſt the tenth Commandment. And thus there was a Univerſal diſobedience in <hi>Adams</hi> eating the forbidden fruit, (there is the ſeed of all ſin in Original ſin) and therefore ſuch an exact obedience to the moral, or natural as well as to the poſitive Law, was required there, as rendred it a Law or Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p>But man cannot now obtain happineſs and Salvation by his own doing according to that, for it is ſaid to be <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Not of Works leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> So that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48981:28"/>
Jeſus Chriſt is not given for the renewing that old Covenant of Works with us again, as the way to eternal life, though the matter of it is drawn into the Covenant of grace, to be performed by him for us, as may be further manifeſted afterward.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided <hi>for the recovery of ſome by Jeſus Chriſt, from a ſtate of ſin and death unto a ſtate of righteouſneſs and eternal life.</hi> All that conduceth to Salvation, is of grace <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>By grace ye are ſaved. Rom.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>If by grace, then it is no more of works, otherwiſe grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe work is no more work.</hi> The way of Salvation is here aſcribed unto grace, the holy Spirit giveth us both the terms of the diſtinction, by making <hi>grace and works</hi> ſuch oppoſite terms, as one excludeth the other: that therefore made with the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was a <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> that for reſtoration by Jeſus Chriſt, is a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. 27, 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of Jeſus Chriſt in our ſtead, to be our ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> was as by Covenant, ſo of meer grace, as well as what is promiſed to us through him; they together make up but one Covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>Some call the former a <hi>Covenant of amity
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48981:29"/>
or friendſhip,</hi> becauſe God and man were in perfect amity, and a Covenant <hi>of nature,</hi> becauſe natural integrity did capacitate to perform it; but theſe do not ſo fully expreſs the nature of it, ſeeing the promiſed life therein was to be by working.</p>
               <p>Some call the latter a <hi>Covenant of faiths</hi> and there is indeed an oppoſition between <hi>the Law of faith and the Law of Works,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the matter of juſtification. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27, 28. That particular priviledge of the Covenant <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification, is by ſaith, and not by the works of the Law; but in a diſtribution, theſe are not the moſt diſtinct members o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the whole Covenant; ſeeing Faith, is but particular bleſſing and fruit of it, hence that cannot be expreſſive of the whole nature thereof: that is not the oppoſite Condition, or doth not take the place that works had in that Covenant with the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> it is rather what was done or ſuffered by Jeſus Chriſt that ſupplieth this. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10, It is therefore improper, eſpecially unleſs by <hi>faith,</hi> be meant the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt applyed thereby, rather than that particular grace for application.</p>
               <p>And note, that in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> juſtification is ſaid to be <hi>by faith</hi> in oppoſition only <hi>to works,</hi> not <hi>to Jeſus Chriſt or free grace.</hi> If we ſhould
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48981:29"/>
give <hi>faith</hi> the place that was given by the falſe Prophets unto <hi>works,</hi> we ſhould be culpable and egregiouſly croſs the mind of the Apoſtle in this matter as well as they did. Some <hi>Grace</hi> in that Covenant with the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> do no more make it coincident with or deny that in and with Chriſt to be a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace,</hi> than ſome <hi>Works (viz.</hi> Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical) in that with Chriſt, doth deny that with the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> to be a <hi>Covenant of Works;</hi> or than ſome <hi>faith</hi> in God, required in <hi>the Covenant of Works (viz.</hi> the believing that word <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.) doth deny that which they call the Covenant of faith to be ſo.</p>
               <p>It muſt therefore be ſaid, it was not Goſpel grace, or faith in a Mediator that was found in the Covenant of Works, and ſo as properly as this may be denominated of <hi>Works,</hi> ſo may the other be called a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace,</hi> eſpecially ſeeing the Goſpel is called the word of grace. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 32.</p>
               <p>As to the ſeveral parts following in the diſtribution of this <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> ſome of them carry evidence with them, as what is ſaid of <hi>primary revelation,</hi> renovation, <hi>conſummation,</hi> &amp;c. the other will be further cleared in the ſequel; yet thus much I would ſay here, for the clearing of them.</p>
               <p>That the Covenant of grace was made
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48981:30"/>
with Jeſus Chriſt, that Text doth witneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 6. for the Father is contracting with him, yea all <hi>the Covenant of the people</hi> is firſtly with him; he not only removeth obſtacles that would hinder their fruition of federal bleſſings as an intereſted Friend (whoſe name is not in a Covenant) may do among men; but he is the great Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanteer <hi>[a Covenant of the people]:</hi> the promiſes are primarily made to him on the behalf of men; and he maketh the firſt claim to all, as his own right, his own due by a grant or Covenant under the hand and ſeal of the Father to himſelf; this will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the next queſtion.</p>
               <p>That alſo the Covenant is made <hi>with us in Chriſt,</hi> is no leſs evident. Believers are of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and of the houſe of ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> to whom the promiſes run, they may lay claim to them in their head. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 9, 14, 29. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 37. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8.</p>
               <p>If any doubt of the ſecond diſtinction, into <hi>Legal and Evangelical;</hi> let them know, I am far from thinking that the mount <hi>Sinai</hi> diſpenſation was a Covenant of Works to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> as if the deſign and intendment of God therein had been to afford eternal life to <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon their own doing: but yet, it is called <hi>[the Law] Rom.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48981:30"/>
13, 17. Even in way of oppoſition to the promiſe <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. Yea. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. God—preached before the Goſpel to <hi>Abraham.—</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>Abraham</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly called <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and that in contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction from the very <hi>Sinai</hi> diſpenſation, which is called <hi>the Law;</hi> undeniably he ſpeaketh of the Law, not as given to <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall (for then man himſelf muſt have been the door for life, and not another for him) but as given at mount <hi>Sinai</hi> 430: Years after that promiſe to faithful <hi>Abraham.</hi> verſ. 17.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>the Covenant of grace,</hi> is rightly diſtinguiſhed, <hi>by legal and Evangelical,</hi> for the holy Spirit here giveth us both parts of the diſtinction, ſpeaking expreſly of that at mount <hi>Sinai</hi> as one member of it; yea he maketh theſe ſo oppoſite, as he ſaith <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>and the Law, is not of faith,</hi> and ſo is not the Covenant of grace, but yet the <hi>Sinai</hi> Law appertaineth and referreth to it, <hi>viz.</hi> as holding forth <hi>the Condition thereof to be fulfilled by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Oneneſs of the Covenant with Jeſus Chriſt and us.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>THe Covenant of grace was made or eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed not only with us, but joyntly with Jeſus Chriſt and us in him ſo as both are within one and the ſame Covenant.</hi> For, the great tranſactions with Jeſus, yea even the giving and ſending of him, and his accepting the office of a Redeemer and undertaking for us, theſe are all of grace, as well as what is promiſed to us through him, therefore <hi>the Covenant of grace,</hi> muſt take in all that conduceth (otherwiſe than by a meer Decree) to our reſtoration and eternal Salvation. And in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 6. the Father is contracting with the Son, I will <hi>[give thee]</hi> for a Covenant of the people; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that with the Son and with the people belong to one and the ſame Covenant.</p>
               <p>Indeed as that which partaketh of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or is a part, is put for the whole, ſo that with the people alone, even here, beareth the name of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> as being
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48981:31"/>
within the grand contract with Jeſus Chriſt as a branch and parcel thereof, yet both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make up that one Covenant of grace, as appeareth thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is no Scripture Evidence for making theſe, two Covenants, one of Surety ſhip or redemption with Jeſus Chriſt, and another of grace and reconciliation made with us:</hi> that diſtinction which ſome uſe, is improper, for the parts of it are coincident, ſeeing that as with Jeſus Chriſt was out of meer grace alſo: <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. And it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould <hi>be given</hi> for a Covenant, therefore it is of grace that we are redeemed by him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. There was <hi>grace</hi> before the World was, and that muſt be in the Covenant as with Jeſus Chriſt: which was for the <hi>reconciling the World</hi> unto the Father. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>It is true, Chriſt only is our ſurety and Redeemer, not we in our own perſons; yea he is our head, our Lord, and King, and on that account of his ſtanding in thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent capacities he hath ſome peculiar precepts and promiſes appropriated to him, which are not afforded to us in the ſame manner or degree; yet this hindreth not the Oneneſs of the Covenant with him and us: as, it is promiſed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that in him all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48981:32"/>
the Families of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed, that he ſhould be a Father of many Nations. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. and 17. 4. Which promiſes are of a higher nature than are made to us (for every Believer is not the Father of many Nations) yet we are within the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that was made with <hi>Abraham. Rom.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>As in Covenants between Princes, ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles may be concerning prerogatives or royalties that are peculiar to them in their publick capacities, which the people ſhare not in but in them, as ſtriking ſayl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> other grants may concern the people in their private capacities, as Merchants, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet Prince and people within the ſame contract. So doubtleſs there may be diverſe grants to Jeſus Chriſt in his publick capacity in the office of a Mediator, other promiſes made to his Seed; yet King and Subjects, head and members, are within one and the ſame Covenant; as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal debtor and the ſurety within the ſame obligation. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>the ſame Covenant of grace,</hi> may be diſtinguiſhed, <hi>as it is made with Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and, <hi>as with us,</hi> yet not to intimate two diſtinct and compleat Covenants, but two Subjects of the ſame Covenant. <hi>As with Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it had its conſtitution from
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48981:32"/>
eternity, before we had a being, <hi>as with us,</hi> it hath its application in time after we exiſt. I had rather therefore diſtinguiſh one and the ſame Covenant of grace into theſe two parts. 1. <hi>For redemption and reconciliation;</hi> this as with Jeſus Chriſt for us. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. 2 <hi>For Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> this as with us in him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10.</p>
               <p>From eternity Jeſus Chriſt was a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator undertaking the Covenant; but in time is executing and interceding for our participation of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Covenant of grace was made with Jeſus Chriſt as a publick perſon, a ſecond</hi> Adam, and therefore <hi>with all his Seed in him:</hi> the Covenant of Works being violated, Jeſus Chriſt was appointed as the means for reſtoration and recovery. He was <hi>our Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, King of Saints Iſa.</hi> 53. 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 32. and ſo repreſented many Subjects, he was a <hi>common parent,</hi> having a great Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Seed. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. The <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> was a figure of him that was to come. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>i. e.</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and wherein it is ſpecified, as <hi>the firſt</hi> ſtanding for his Seed derived unto them, <hi>ſin and miſery, death and condemnation;</hi> So <hi>the ſecond,</hi> ſtanding for, and repreſenting his Seed, deriveth unto them, <hi>righteouſneſs, juſtification and eternal life. verſ.</hi> 15. to the end. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45, 47.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:48981:33"/>
Thus they are compared together and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the Second, preferred before the firſt.</p>
               <p>If the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had never fallen, it is not imaginable that he ſhould have injoyed life by one Covenant and his poſterity by another; their life would have been by keeping as their death was by breaking one and the ſame Law of Works: So, Jeſus Chriſt the Second <hi>Adam</hi> and all his ſpiritual Seed injoy juſtification and life by one and the ſame Covenant of grace, <hi>We are quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together with him, Coloſſ.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>i. e.</hi> as our common perſon ſtanding in our ſtead.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>All in the Covenant as with us is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for and promiſed in the Covenant as between the Father and the Son, and ſo together make up but one Covenant.</hi> For, his being <hi>the Covenant of the people,</hi> implieth, that all promiſed to or to be performed by the people, it is ſecured in the contract with Jeſus Chriſt. Whatſoever was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite unto our reſtoration, redemption, and reconciliation, he agreed to work it out. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. there were the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and end in that as with him, and that as with us. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20.</p>
               <p>Yea all neceſſaries alſo for application is in the Covenant as with him. Is Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and the giving of a new heart promiſed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48981:33"/>
to us? <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. The ſame is promiſed to Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 11. <hi>By his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (i. e.</hi> by the knowledge of him) <hi>ſhall my righteous Servant (i. e.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>juſtify many—</hi>and <hi>he ſhall ſee his Seed, and be a light to the Gentiles.</hi> Iſa. 4. 2. 6. Which implyeth newneſs of heart, and having God for their God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>All bleſſings afforded in a Covenant way to us, were primarily granted to Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and therefore <hi>the Covenant is joyntly with him and us:</hi> as Mr. <hi>R.</hi> obſerveth, Chriſt is firſt juſtified and acquitted from the guilt of ſin, and then we. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 11. Chriſt firſt Sanctified and filled with the Spirit and then we. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 1. He firſt glorified and then we. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. Jeſus Chriſt is our great <hi>Fcoſee in truſt,</hi> he hath all the riches of grace and glory granted to, and veſted in him to our uſe and behoof, both have them by the ſame Covenant.</p>
               <p>Indeed he hath the precedency, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth in dignity and power, he is the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born among many brethren. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. the firſt born from the dead. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 18, 19. All fulneſs dwelling in him; all is firſtly granted into his hands and in the Second place to us. If we would obtain any Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual giſts, any graces, any comforts, any glory, we muſt be beholden to him, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48981:34"/>
all from his ſtore, receive all from his hand. The Divine Spirit is from him <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 7, 8. All grace from him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 20, 24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 23. Repentance from him, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. <hi>He is exalted to give repentance and the forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> Faith it ſelf from him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. Which argue that all flow from the ſame Covenant. The Name of Jeſus Chriſt is in the Covenant, he is the principal party there, to whom all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are primarily made on our behalf.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Union with Jeſus Chriſt is the only way to promiſed bleſſings, and therefore the Covenant is made joyntly with him and us:</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20.

               </p>
               <p>I might argue alſo, from Jeſus Chriſt his receiving the ſame <hi>ſigns with us, Baptiſm and the Supper,</hi> and why were they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to him, if he were under one Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and we under another?</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>All the antient Covenant expreſſures run joyntly to Jeſus Chriſt, and alſo to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers which are his Seed:</hi> the promiſes to <hi>Adam, Abraham, David,</hi> &amp;c. were not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48981:34"/>
ſo many diſtinct Covenants of grace; they were but various gradual diſcoveries of the ſame Covenant according to the variety of occaſions in the ſeveral ages, every new one being for ſome new end and bringing with it a further degree of manifeſtation, and all run to Jeſus Chriſt and us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That gracious promiſe revealed to</hi> Adam <hi>primarily runneth unto Jeſus Chriſt, as to the bleſſed Seed, and then to us in him:</hi> wretched man having eaten of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, what could he expect every moment but the execution of that dreadful Sentence. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>In the day thou eateſt dying thou ſhalt die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O what unexpreſſible aſtoniſhment muſt needs ſeize upon his guilty Soul on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, there being no contrivance by any Creature wiſdom, no way open, either for the eſcaping the ſtroke of Divine wrath or for ſtanding under it; for, how ſhould a feeble Creature bear up, or avoid being cruſhed under the weight of an omnipotent arm?</p>
               <p>Now, behold in the cool of the day, when the ſhadows of the evening were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon undone, fallen man, then was the firſt dawning of a day of grace, ſaith God <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy Seed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48981:35"/>
and her Seed, it ſhall bruiſe thy head,</hi> &amp;c. The bowels of Divine compaſſion did ſo tenderly rowle towards him, that he could not paſs one day, without ſome intimation of his love and revealing his gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments towards him.</p>
               <p>Indeed this was immediately ſpoken, <hi>not to</hi> Adam <hi>as a promiſe,</hi> but <hi>to the Serpent as a threatning,</hi> yet was uttered that <hi>Adam</hi> might over-hear and Spell out Something of a promiſe in it. But, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily this Seed of the woman which brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Serpents head;</hi> For, it is he that ſtandeth Conquerour over all the enemies of Salvation, <hi>ſin, Satan, death, and Hell,</hi> he procureth their utter overthrow, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth the works of the Devil. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 8. Vanquiſheth and overcometh him. <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 9. Chriſt is chiefly intended by it. Believers are Victorious only in and by Jeſus Chriſt, they <hi>overcome by the blood of the Lamb,</hi> and ſo the promiſe is joyntly to him and them.</p>
               <p>Many matters in this firſt diſcovery of the Covenant did lie dark and were hidden, it not diſcovering diſtinctly, what Seed of the woman it ſhould be, nor the way or means, to this or that he ſhould be God as well as man, and how this ſhould be brought about, which were afterward revealed.</p>

2. <hi>The Covenant with</hi> Abraham <hi>was joyntly with Jeſus Chriſt and us:</hi> there was <hi>a gracious promiſe</hi> (which ſaith might hang upon) as early as the days of <hi>Adam;</hi> this was a <hi>promiſe</hi> of a bleſſed Seed to be given <hi>for man,</hi> but <hi>the Covenant with man</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, ſeemeth to be dated, not from <hi>Adam,</hi> but from <hi>Abraham. Gal.</hi> 3. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord was pleaſed to deal with <hi>Abraham</hi> in a more familiar way than with others before him, putting himſelf under Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ingagements to him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>In thee ſhall all the families of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> and Gen. 17.</p>
               <p>They muſt needs be at a great loſs about the Seed of the woman, of whoſe poſterity it ſhould come, and it was the chief <hi>addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional excellency</hi> of this federal expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to aſſure <hi>Abraham</hi> that the <hi>Meſſia</hi> ſhould come of his Seed according to the fleſh. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 18. <hi>In [thy Seed] ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> and thus that which was more general in the former to <hi>Adam,</hi> is here more particular, for it is reſtrained to this family, and it was an advantage to know the family which he ſhould come of. There were other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to him, as concerning <hi>the land of Canaan,</hi> and that the Lord would be <hi>his God. Gen.</hi> 17. 7. The latter was hinted

               <p n="4">4. <hi>The New Covenant runneth joyntly to Jeſus Chriſt and us;</hi> for he died as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> not of the <hi>old</hi> but of the <hi>new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Heb. 9. 15.

               <p>But ſeeing all are made and fulfilled in Chriſt, hence they muſt all flow as living ſtreams from that Fountain. The Covenant of grace with Jeſus Chriſt that is the great Charter that we hold all our priviledges by; and all the promiſes do ſome way or other appertain to that.</p>
               <p>Some Promiſes are <hi>Conſtitutive,</hi> of the Covenant, as thoſe between the Father and the Son concerning a Seed; others are <hi>executive</hi> or referring to the execution and

application of it. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53, 10, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 11, 12.</p>

And whence was all this care over them? <hi>verſ.</hi> 42. <hi>For he remembred his holy Covenant and</hi> Abraham <hi>his Servant.</hi> All theſe then were to be deemed Covenant mercies. Where had the Lord particularly promiſed any ſuch extraordinary relieves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abraham</hi> or his Seed? O he witneſſed himſelf to be their God, and promiſed the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that implyeth all mercy and means neceſſary for them in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the Call to it. So that all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48981:38"/>
preſervations, proviſions, all for the ſuſtaining upholding and ſuccouring of the people of God, yea even their loweſt mercies, have a tincture of Covenant-love to put quickneſs into them. So, returns of prayer in a day of outward affliction are in remembrance of his Covenant. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 44. 45. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>Yea obſerve, in ſome places where the Covenant is mentioned, there are promiſes added (and ſo belong to it) which in other repetitions of it are left out. As <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 38, 39, 40. <hi>One-neſs of heart and way and his fear</hi> in their hearts, are promiſed in the Covenant, yet are omitted in the recital thereof. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31, to 35. And the Word <hi>Covenant</hi> is omitted, and yet many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes thereof are mentioned. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25, to the end, as appeareth by the identity of ſome with thoſe expreſly in it elſe-where. So, that, we are not to confine <hi>the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace</hi> to thoſe mentioned in the new Covenant; all the promiſes to us are ſome way compriſed in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> 2. Hence, <hi>there is infallible certainty in, and grounded conſolation iſſuing from, the Covenant of grace, ſeeing it is made joyntly with Jeſus Chriſt and us.</hi>

               <p>All the promiſes are his right as well as

               <p>So are Believers: yea they are of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> intereſted in the ſame promiſes. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19, 21.</p>

The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works,</hi> was founded upon ſomething in man, his concreated ability and natural ſtrength; all the obedience of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> (if he had ſtood) and the fruits thereof, would have been reſulting from the ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his own power and free-will, and he failing all the fabrick fell.</p>

                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:48981:40"/>
But the Lord hath eſtabliſhed <hi>another glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Covenant,</hi> and this is built upon what is firmer and of greater ſtrength, even Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; this ſtone that is laid in <hi>Zion,</hi> is a tried ſtone. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 16. <hi>A ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</hi> Now the ſtructure of our Salvation will never fall, becauſe it hath ſuch a ſure ground-work, able to bear up the weight and ſtreſs of all that is laid upon it; No other can be laid.

If the Lord be a God to any, it is in Chriſt, if their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities be forgiven it is in the blood of Chriſt, if the Divine Law be written in their hearts, it is by the finger of the ſpirit of Chriſt; thus he lieth at the bottom of all, and ſo is the Covenant of the people.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>As he is our Spiritual head and the bleſſed Seed, ſo he is a party contracting in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:</hi> he is the chief Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of <hi>David, Gal.</hi> 3.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48981:43"/>
and he being a party it were an injury to him, if any thing were unfulfilled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As he is the Subſtance of the Covenant, ſo he is ſaid to be the Covenant of the people;</hi> and well may he bear this name he ſtanding in all theſe relations to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt was the principal promiſe of the Covenant:</hi> this denominates him the <hi>Covenant,</hi> his being really the chief part of it, or thing firſtly promiſed in it, and all other things for his ſake. Thus he primarily was the Seed of the woman that was promiſed to break the Serpents head. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 8. He is that Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in whom <hi>all the Nations are bleſſed.</hi> Gen. 22. 18. Gal. 3. 16. He is the royal Seed of <hi>David</hi> to be enthroned, of whoſe Kingdom there ſhall be no end. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 32, 33.</p>
               <p>Indeed this is a grand priviledge of Goſpel times, that what was of old the great thing under promiſe to come <hi>viz. a bleſſed Seed, a Meſſiah,</hi> is now turned into a performance, and he now ſtandeth <hi>actually a Mediator,</hi> in ſtead thereof.

4. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is really to us all that which under any antient Covenant was typically repreſented unto men;</hi> and ſo he is <hi>Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi> the Covenant of the people: as Dr. <hi>Sibs</hi> obſerveth, Chriſt is all to us which was held forth of old either <hi>in perſonal types,</hi> he is the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> the true <hi>Iſaac, Joſeph, Joſhua, Solomon, Melchiſedeck—</hi>Or in <hi>real types,</hi> he is the true braſen Serpent that cureth ſin-ſtung ſouls which by an eye of faith are looking to him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14, 15. He is the true <hi>Manna, bread of life,</hi> to all thoſe that believingly feed upon him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 31, 33, 35. He is the true ſacrifice, the Paſchal Lamb; our hearts being ſprinkled with his blood, the deſtroying Angel ſhall paſs over us. He is our true Tabernacle, true Altar, and true Ark, all typified by theſe, is really fulfilled in him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the excellency, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſweetneſs, yea the ſum and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all that is under promiſe, and ſo he is the Covenant of the people:</hi> indeed he is the very ſtore-houſe where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are treaſured up.

32. <hi>How ſhall be not [with him] alſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give us all things.</hi> It is Chriſt that putteth fulneſs into other things, and addeth ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them, they are imbittered, and as nothing if without him. <hi>The promiſes</hi> (though full in themſelves yet) are empty to us unleſs taken with Chriſt; all priviledges empty, all injoyments empty, unleſs taken with him; hence he is ſaid to be <hi>all in all.</hi> Col. 3. 11. He is all in all graces, all in all peace, in all promiſes, in all comforts, in all glory.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt doth all that is neceſſary for the procurement of all federal bleſſings; and ſo he is the Covenant of the people:</hi> as he is <hi>the reſurrection.</hi> i. e. the cauſe of it. <hi>John</hi> 11. 25.

All that is required in a federal way from the people, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be ſo them: if the Father demandeth it of them, they muſt not preſent him with any duties or performances of their own for acceptation unto life, but with Jeſus Chriſt, he is their Covenant to perform all for them, which they are obliged to, in order to that end. Saith the Lord, I will not enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or deal in an immediate way with them as with the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> but I will take a

               <p>All that is promiſed to Jeſus Chriſt, or to us, it is upon his obedience. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10, 11, 12.</p>

David <hi>thy ſervant.</hi> When looking <hi>Death</hi> in the face it may be of <hi>comforting uſe</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 5. <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant.</hi> Theſe were the <hi>laſt words</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> verſ. 1. So that this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Covenant may make a dying man lift up his head with rejoycing.

                  <hi>Corol.</hi> 2. Hence, <hi>there are tranſcended excellencies in the Covenant of grace, far above what are found in the Covenant of Works:</hi> For, here the Father is promiſing unto the Son, that he ſhould be <hi>a Covenant of the people,</hi> the excellency of this might be evinced from its properties, it is <hi>a free, gratious, holy, well regulated, ſure, and an everlaſting Covenant,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 9. Luk. 1. 72. 2 Sam. 23. 5. Iſa. 55. 3. Theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing largely handled by others, I do but touch upon them.</p>
               <p>Alſo the vaſt <hi>difference</hi> between thoſe <hi>Covenants of Works and of Grace</hi> clear this. This <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> was made with the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and with all his ſeed in him, without a Mediator, requiring perfect, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal obedience, by his natural concreated
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48981:49"/>
power, with free-will to ſtand or fall, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, promiſing life upon keeping and threatiſing death and a forfeiture of all upon breaking of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. It ſpeaketh nothing of remiſſion of ſin, upon the deepeſt ſorrow and repentance: if <hi>Adam</hi> could have wept day and night, and even tears of blood; yet that promiſed nothing, not the leaſt mercy or favour after its violation, nothing but death to be expected from it; which ſpeaketh the miſery of all who are in a natural condition, and not come under a better Covenant.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> is made with Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and with all his ſeed in him, as their Mediator to make it conciliation, and work out a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for them, ſo as now the promiſe is ſure to all the Seed, 1 Tim. 2. 5. Rom. 4. 16.</p>
               <p>The Father is Covenanting with Jeſus Chriſt as a more glorious head than the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> promiſing to give him to be a Covenant of the people, to ſtand on their ſide: this muſt argue a pacification in that he who was God, (the perſon offended) would be God-man, a redeemer, ſo as he and the people make but one party in this Covenant; yea, he wrought out that righteouſneſs which is unto juſtification of life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:48981:50"/>
In handling the ſubject of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> the cleareſt way is, to compare <hi>the Covenant of Works</hi> with the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace</hi> with Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> together; ſo the two <hi>Adams</hi> are paralleled, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>And alſo to compare, the <hi>old Covenant</hi> at mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> with <hi>the new Covenant,</hi> as Jer. 31. <hi>v.</hi> 31, 32. The jumbling of theſe together hath occaſioned darkneſs in many matters; theſe differences being rightly ſtated, in a ſecondary way any of them, might be compared, with leſs danger of miſcarrying.</p>

Hence, <hi>it is rich grace and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favour to be in the number of the people that were Covenanted for, between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son;</hi> ſeeing none are freed from the ſentence of death and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſaved, but in the way of <hi>a Covenant of grace,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 8. 2 Tim. 1. 9. The being under that, is not a priviledge that betideth all; it reacheth ſome and not others: For, there is no Covenant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſure that extendeth now to all man-kind without exception, that <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that ſome are <hi>the Seed of the Serpent,</hi> as others are <hi>the Seed of the Woman;</hi> all the world are <hi>not the Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>or</hi> David, nor <hi>the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and</hi> Judah,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48981:50"/>
with whom the new Covenant is made <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. The Fathers <hi>act of donation</hi> was not of <hi>all</hi> without exception, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 9. <hi>I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me—</hi>The Antitheſis or oppoſition, doth ſtrongly prove, that <hi>ſome</hi> are <hi>of the world,</hi> and theſe are <hi>not given</hi> unto Jeſus Chriſt, nor <hi>prayed for</hi> by him. It would ſound harſh to ſay, either that he Covenanted with the Father to die for and redeem ſome that were never <hi>given</hi> him, or that he would not intercede and pray for ſome that he did <hi>redeem;</hi> and the <hi>giving act</hi> was <hi>abſolute,</hi> not upon the <hi>condition</hi> of our believing. For, <hi>Job.</hi> 6. 37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come to me.</hi> All them that were <hi>given</hi> ſhall certainly believe (and ſo <hi>ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mark 16. 16.) and therefore <hi>ſome</hi> were never <hi>given</hi> to him. Impetration and application are of equal latitude and extent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. From <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation</hi> which is by the <hi>death</hi> of his Son, the Apoſtle argueth unto <hi>Salvation</hi> with a much more. All thoſe therefore that it was purchaſed for, ſhall certainly have it applied to them, and be reconciled in their own perſons.</p>
               <p>Yea in the great Charter, the Covenant as between the Father and the Son an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual application of ſederal bleſſings is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48981:51"/>
promiſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10, 11. <hi>He [Shall] ſee his Seed,</hi> and he <hi>[Shall] ſee of the travail of his Soul and be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> and he <hi>[Shall] juſtifie many.</hi> How many [Shalls] are here, and on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, becauſe he [Shall bear their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties]. All then whoſe iniquities he did bear, he ſhall convert and juſtifie. He hath the higheſt aſſurance that he ſhould enjoy the very Seed which he travelled for: it was not a meer conditional ſatisfaction that he made; upon his death all matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came abſolute: the very perſons were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and an unalterable determination of the Father concerning their converſion, which cannot reach unto all men without exception, for then all ſhould certainly be ſaved. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 6, 7. It is not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that he ſhould be a Covenant <hi>[of the people]</hi> the Jews, but alſo <hi>[a light of the Gentiles];</hi> which importeth a removing of ſpiritual blindneſs by affording ſpecial illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations: not only will he be redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Gentiles, but <hi>a light</hi> for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of it to all that he hath redeemed. Yea, he will bring them <hi>from the Priſon,</hi> from their ſpiritual thraldom and bondage, to ſin and Satan, which denote <hi>effectual vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> Acts 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 47, 48.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48981:51"/>
grace unto converſion is abſolutely promiſed to be vouchſafed unto all thoſe that Jeſus Chriſt did undertake for; yet you ſee there, that the accompliſhment hereof, is by waies and means of his appointment, and the Lord doth not mock or delude men, in the general invitations and calls of the Goſpel, any more than he mocked <hi>Pharoah,</hi> when he (by <hi>Moſes)</hi> commanded him to <hi>let Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael go,</hi> and yet declared that he would <hi>barden his heart, that he ſhould not let the people go,</hi> Exod. 4. 21. 23. The Lord by his <hi>Will of Precept</hi> commandeth all where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Goſpel cometh to <hi>believe,</hi> and all which do <hi>believe</hi> ſhall certainly be <hi>Saved, Mark</hi> 16. 16. and therefore he doth not mock. The diſpenſation of the Goſpel is the means which he ſanctifieth and bleſſeth to that end, for the working or begetting <hi>of Faith.</hi> If any will neglect, abuſe, and miſimprove or <hi>make light of it,</hi> Mat. 22. <hi>v.</hi> 5. and intreat ſpightfully the meſſengers that are ſent with that bleſſed tidings; or if they will be attended to their worldly matters, their <hi>Farms and Oxen—</hi>They ſinning againſt the means of grace, it is a putting a ſlight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the grace and ſalvation tendred in the means, and this leaveth inexcuſable and will expoſe the ſinners to juſt condemnation. They had <hi>power</hi> to forbear ſuch acts of ſin
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48981:52"/>
againſt the <hi>means,</hi> though they had <hi>not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> to render it <hi>effectual;</hi> and who (either Speaker or Hearer) knoweth that he is not of that number, which Jeſus Chriſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted for and will make it effectual to? however, the Lord is not bound to <hi>abat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> of his demand of duty, becauſe of mans impotency and (ſinfully contracted) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to obey.</p>
               <p>All therefore ought to give utmoſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to the general call of the Goſpel, as a matter of higheſt concernment to their ſouls for Eternity; and the neglecting hereof is a <hi>deſpiſing</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt and his benefits, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 16. And then no wonder if the wrath of God abideth on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> 4. <hi>Hence there were glorious tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions in order to the ſalvation of the Elect, long before their believing:</hi> though the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al application of federal bleſſings to them, is not one moment of time before the gift of Faith, yet before that there are glorious advantages, ariſing from the Covenant, as between the Father and the Son on their behalf.</p>
               <p>Vertually and <hi>ex faedere</hi> all conducing unto happineſs was ſecured for them from Eternity; then there was not only a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch an act as they cannot <hi>eventually</hi> be damued (which is ſo far from proving an
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48981:52"/>
actual juſtification as that) a meer decree of <hi>Election,</hi> would have been ſufficient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, ſeeing that muſt certainly have its <hi>execution,</hi> but by a <hi>federal act,</hi> ſo early was the undertaking of Jeſus Chriſt on their behalf; then was the Covenant made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Son, which had all bleſſedneſs in the womb of it, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. Indeed he had not <hi>actually</hi> our <hi>ſin</hi> upon him, nor was ſo <hi>juſtified</hi> before his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 7, 8. For, his coming in the fleſh had been vain and unneceſſary, if he had been actually diſcharged before.</p>
               <p>And this may ſhew that our juſtification doth not every way run parallel to his; For, believers under the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> were actually <hi>juſtified</hi> before Jeſus Chriſt was ſo: but ſo early the Elect did in ſome ſpecial way belong unto God, being federally made over by him to Jeſus Chriſt for gratious ends, <hi>Job.</hi> 17. 6. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this was a great buſineſs, for he was appointed to be their repreſentative, and to pay their ranſom money, ſo as when he did it, they were virtually deemed as juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, yea ſanctified and glorified there, <hi>not</hi> in their own <hi>perſons,</hi> but <hi>in him,</hi> Eph. 2. 5, 6. <hi>Hath quickened us together with Chriſt, and hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit

               <p>
                  <hi>Corol.</hi> 5. Hence, <hi>there was ſome love in the boſom of God towards the Elect from all Eternity:</hi> Sending Chriſt himſelf (who is given for a Covenant and is the ſum of it) is the fruit and effect of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16 <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> only begotten Son—</hi>And if the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was from everlaſting, then that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love, which is the Fountain and firſt ſpring from whence it floweth, muſt needs be ſo early alſo.</p>
               <p>God doth actually love the Elect before they are regenerate or can actually believe, with a <hi>love of benevolence</hi> or good will, though not with <hi>a love of complacency</hi> and delight. He beareth <hi>love,</hi> to their <hi>perſons,</hi> though not to their <hi>qualities and actions,</hi> nor to their ſtate and condition. Yea, God owneth them not only with <hi>electing</hi> but with <hi>redeeming</hi> love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> This extolleth his love, and maketh it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount all others, that he gave his Son to die for them, whilſt they were in a ſtate of ſin and miſery. There was ſome <hi>federal love</hi> ſo far as to give them unto Jeſus Chriſt to be <hi>redeemed</hi> by him, <hi>Job.</hi> 6. 37, 39. So as to owne them as the perſons which ſhould
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48981:53"/>
ſhare in Covenant grace afterward when others were left out. The <hi>love of God</hi> is an unchangeable and eternal act of his Will, ever one and the ſame, admitteth of no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or decreaſe in him; he doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to love any perſon that he hated before, <hi>be changeth not,</hi> Mal. 3. 6. But to help our weak underſtandings, according to his acting towards us, and to the change that is made in us, and as we partake of his benefits, ſo he is ſaid to let it out to us, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed on us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God.</hi> Thus the Lord loveth not his creatures equally, or all alike, but ſome more than others; the regenerate more than the unregenerate, and thoſe moſt, who ſhare moſt in the effects of it, both for this life, and that which is to come. From <hi>Eternity,</hi> although God had not <hi>a love of approbation</hi> to the ſtate of the Elect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, yet he had a love <hi>of commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> unto their perſons, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 17. <hi>But the mercy of the Lord</hi> (which hath miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable creatures as the proper objects of it) <hi>is from everlaſting to everlaſting upon them that fear him,</hi> &amp;c. Before the foundations of the earth were laid, he conſidered them as poſſibly miſerable, and was a God of mercy. Then he had ſuch a love of benevolence to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48981:54"/>
them as certainly iſſueth in a love of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence or ſoul inriching bounty, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 4, 5. <hi>But God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in ſins, hath quickened us together with Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Here the firſt operations of Divine grace, the recovery of a ſoul out of a dead ſtate unto ſpiritual life, the firſt quickenings of a ſoul from the death of ſin are made the iſſues of Divine favour, they ſpring from mercy and rich mercy, from love and great love.</p>

Whereas, Jeſus Chriſt (who was the head of the Covenant of grace) was not only really exiſting but undertaking from Eternity. The <hi>Covenant of grace,</hi> (without any incongruity) may be aſſerted, in its <hi>conſtitution</hi> and making to be firſt, or before the Covenant of Works, though in its <hi>execution and application</hi> it cometh after, and preſuppoſeth the breaking

It was conceived in the heart and boſome of God, and none but he had to do in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of it, and ſo he is alone to be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and extolled therein. A Chriſtian, as one tranſported, may cry out on this account, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 1. <hi>O Lord I will exalt thee—<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for thou haſt done wonderful things, thy Counſels [of old] are faithfulneſs and truth.</hi> Now, there is no room for our boaſting, nothing to be aſcribed to our ſelves, God alone is to be admired in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant grace, ſeeing it was working towards as from all Eternity, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. It is ſaid to be, <hi>not according to our Works.</hi> The Eternity of our mercy is excluſive of our

We may have hope to receive, what the Lord was ſo early determined to give out, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure.</hi> The apoſtaſie of eminent profeſſors is a great temptation unto many ſincere Chriſtians: they are apt to ſay, If ſuch gliſtering, ſhining Stars fall, good Lord how ſhall we ſtand? But to help againſt it, he telleth us, the <hi>foundation</hi> that is ſtedfaſt, firm, unmoveable, it <hi>ſtandeth ſure,</hi> by the Covenant of grace they are granted to Jeſus Chriſt from all Eternity, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. Such eternal acts of God are firm and ſtable, abiding for ever, will ſecure againſt defection or falling away; <hi>Satan</hi> ſhall never utterly prevail againſt them; <hi>grace</hi> ſhall never utterly be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown or extinguiſhed. <hi>[Having this Seal; the Lord knoweth them that are his.]</hi>

Anſw. 1. <hi>The worſe Covenant is that Conditional Divine grant of bleſſings upon the obedience required in the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>Or, that Old Covenant which was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount</hi> Sinai: This is undoubtedly it which is compared with the other; For, it is that which the Levitical Prieſthood did belong to, which the Prieſthood of Chriſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with, as is manifeſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7, and 8, and 9. Chapters. <hi>It is that Covenant which the Lord made with the Fathers in the day when he took them by the hand to lead them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. verſ. 9. And therefore undeniably it was the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, for then that was made with them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. verſ. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>&amp;c. In the third moneth when the Children of Iſrael were gone out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>the ſame day they came to the wilderneſs of</hi> Sinai; and both the matter of <hi>the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> and manner of its promulgation, we ſee in that and the following Chapters.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>a conditional grant,</hi> it promiſeth nothing but upon the condition of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. verſ. 5. <hi>[If] ye will obey my voice and keep my Covenant, then ye ſhall be a peculiar treaſure—</hi>All is upon an [If] So <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4, &amp;c. <hi>[If] ye walk in my Statutes and keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and do them, then will I give

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>whole Law</hi> is generally diſtributed into three parts, <hi>viz. Moral, Judicial, and Ceremonial;</hi> no Precept but may be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to one of theſe; and obedience to all of them is required as the condition of this <hi>Sinai Covenant,</hi> or all are compriſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Moral Law</hi> is ſuch a principal part of it, as it beareth the very name of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the Table thereof are called <hi>the Tables of the Covenant,</hi> Exod. 34. <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. Deut. 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 11, 15. Yea the terrible appearances of God in thundrings and lightnings, and the noiſe of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, was at the promulgation of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> before the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> was given forth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. verſ. 16. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 1, to 19.</p>
               <p>So that the firſt conſtitution of the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant was only of the Moral Law; it is very obſervable that <hi>Moſes</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed theſe very Commandments, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. he cloſeth up thus, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>Theſe words the Lord ſpake unto your aſſembly in the mount out of the midſt of the fire, of the Cloud, and of the thick darkneſs [and he added no more]</hi> i. e. in making this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he added no more than theſe Moral

Precepts, although he reſerved to himſelf a liberty to add the <hi>Coremonials</hi> afterward, yet for the preſent he did not; indeed <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> they were contained therein, but <hi>not actually</hi> before the diſcovery of them, any more than Goſpel Inſtitutions which <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not obliged to, until revealed, and after that were equally reducible thereunto. The holy God, that he might tame their rebellious Spirits, he cometh in this terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way, requiring exact obedience to the Moral Commandments <hi>[and added no more]</hi> At the firſt hand, he revealed no way for their relief and ſuccour, yet then, before any Ceremonials were added, it made a Covenant, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2.

That is, ye are not come to <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> and the terrour of that <hi>Old Covenant, but ye are come to Mount Sion—To Jeſus the Mediatour of the New Covenant.</hi>

2.

Theſe are not included in it: but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſcattered up and down in thoſe Books, hath the nature of ſuch a Covenant in it, whereof obedience is the condition, that is to be deemed as belonging to the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> came in by way of <hi>addition</hi> to the other, after an apparent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval, upon their deſiring a Mediator, that might receive the Law for, and declare it to them, <hi>Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>God himſelf uttered the <hi>Moral Law</hi> to the people with great terrour, but the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial</hi> (although it did after belong to the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant yet) was revealed to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount, without thoſe thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings and lightenings which the other
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48981:60"/>
was attended with. I have wondred what ſhould be the reaſon of theſe additional things.</p>
               <p>But I conſider that <hi>temporal mercies</hi> being promiſed by that Covenant unto Iſrael up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their perfect obedience, they would have been hopeleſs of injoying theſe, if ſuch a typical expiation and attonement had not been provided, that their ſins might not hinder their arriving at them. So that <hi>Morals, Ceremonials,</hi> and <hi>Judicials</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to, (and with the promiſes and threatnings annexed, made up) the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant.</p>
               <p>Anſw. 2. <hi>The better Covenant, is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Divine grant by way of Promiſe, of thoſe great bleſſings which come in by the mediation and Miniſtry of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> as its excellency, it is ſaid to be that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is <hi>Mediator,</hi> and ſo it is the <hi>New Covenant or Teſtament,</hi> Heb. 9. 15. and 12. 24. That it runneth upon abſolute terms may be ſeen <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7. to the end. And it is declared that it is not according to the Old, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. Therefore the chief ſcope and deſign of the Apoſtle in mentioning theſe promiſes, rather than any other, is, the diſcovering, wherein eſpecially the New is differenced from, and is ſaid to be better than, the Old.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:48981:60"/>
Here are <hi>four grand Promiſes of the New Covenant</hi> inſtanced in, which are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, as all others made to us, are ſome way reducible to them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The inſcription of the Divine Law in the hearts of men,</hi> Heb. 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>I will put my Laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts.</hi> In the ſtate <hi>of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,</hi> the Law was found in lively Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters there, but ſince <hi>the fall,</hi> it needeth to be tranſcribed or written over again. The <hi>Old Covenant</hi> had the Law written upon <hi>Tables of ſtone</hi> without; not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely promiſed, and but rarely found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; inſomuch as the Lord even weepeth over them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 29. <hi>O that there were ſuch a heart in them, that they would fear me and keep all my Commandments.</hi> But in oppoſition to the Old, here the Lord under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh to write it upon better Tables, even of the <hi>heart:</hi> importing his affording an inward frame, diſpoſition and inclination for an univerſal compliance with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will; and then no ſooner is any thing offered of a Divine ſtamp, but all the faculties of the Soul, underſtanding, will, and affection, with the greateſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, ſtand bent for a conformity to it; yea the Soul is carried forth that way, not ſo much by legal external inforcements, as
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48981:61"/>
by internal powerful obligations: that whereas the Old had a large Volume of Laws, Inſtitutions, and Ordinances, which they were commanded to yield obedience to: in the New all is compriſed in a little room, and turned into Promiſe <hi>[I will write my Law in their Hearts];</hi> the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting for all, is aſſured to them. Here the Promiſe leadeth the way to the <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> And O how ſweet is it, when it beginneth with and is the fruit of a Divine Promiſe!</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A mutual relation between God and Souls,</hi> Heb. 8. 10. <hi>I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people.</hi> Here is propriety each in other. By the <hi>Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> they were <hi>externally</hi> intereſted in God: but as by that with <hi>Abraham</hi> then, ſo by the New ſince, it is more abſolutely promiſed unto ſome that he will be their God; which muſt import that they ſhall have more ſweet converſes and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, under the New than under the Old, and have higher manifeſtations of their injoyment of him. And <hi>happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 144. 15. What then can they want? All Creatures are theirs, yea Chriſt theirs, Grace theirs, Glory theirs, all the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God theirs, his Wiſdom, Power,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48981:61"/>
Goodneſs, Faithfulneſs, Loving kindneſs, all theirs, all his Promiſes, yea his All-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency theirs, and what can they deſire more, than to have him who is all in all?</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>[they ſhall be to me a People]</hi> that is, I will own them in a clearer, more eminent and glorious way, than under the Old. There ſhall be a greater ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Spirit, and in their whole courſe from all corruption, from <hi>Sin, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, the World,</hi> and a greater <hi>dedication unto God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 19, 20. and 2 Cor. 6. 17. Zech. 14. 19, 20. <hi>In that day every Pot in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and in</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to the Lord:</hi> there ſhall be an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal tincture of holineſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 5. <hi>and One</hi> (i. e. one by one) <hi>ſhall ſay, I am the Lords—</hi>There ſhall be a more vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and free ſelf-reſignation unto him; yea when they find their hearts ſtand off and hang back from God, it is under Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <hi>[they ſhall be to me a People]</hi> they may plead the Promiſe for enablement to make over themſelves in a fuller way unto God than formerly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Special illumination is Promiſed,</hi> Heb. 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>They ſhall all know me from the leaſt to the greateſt:</hi> There ſhall be an enlargement of their knowledge and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48981:62"/>
acquaintance with God and Divine things. It would ſeem rather to exclude private teaching than publick <hi>[they ſhall not teach every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother]</hi> but it is not <hi>abſolutely</hi> excluſive of outward teachings by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and means; but <hi>comparatively,</hi> it hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth how ſurpaſſingly excellent thoſe diſcoveries under the New Teſtament ſhould be, above thoſe under the Old; they far tranſcend and go beyond theſe, are more eminent and univerſal: not only <hi>ſome</hi> but <hi>all ſhall know me,</hi> &amp;c.

Forgiving Grace is the very ſpring of other mercies; that maketh way for ſharing in them, and nothing without that.</p>
               <p>There was <hi>a typical forgiveneſs,</hi> in the Old Covenant, <hi>Heb</hi> 9. 9, 10, 14. and 10. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. but there is <hi>real Remiſſion</hi> in the New, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. verſ. 16, 17. and by this, the whole of our Juſtification is noted out: whence the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. from the way of the non-imputation of ſin, proveth our Juſtification to be <hi>by Faith, and not by the works of the Law.</hi>

               <p>Queſt. <hi>Whether that better Covenant</hi> (wherein the miniſtration of Jeſus Chriſt doth lie) <hi>be diſtinct from that at mount</hi> Sinai? <hi>Are they two Covenants, or but one?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>That New or better Covenant is diſtinct from that at Mount</hi> Sinai: it is uſually ſaid, that they are <hi>two adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or diſpenſations of the ſame Covenant:</hi> I think, they are not meerly one and the

                  <hi>ſame Covenant</hi> diverſely adminiſtred, but they are <hi>two Covenants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet to prevent miſtakes, I would explain my meaning herein. I grant that the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai</hi> Covenant had a ſpecial relation to the Covenant of Grace, and was of great uſe thereabout. Alſo I am far from thinking, that there are <hi>two Covenants of Grace,</hi> if thereby be meant, two waies to Life and Salvation <hi>ſpecifically</hi> and <hi>eſſentially</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent each from other. I conclude that the Elect were ſaved in one and the ſame way, for ſubſtance and eſſence in all Ages, <hi>viz.</hi> by Grace, through a Mediator, by Faith in him. The <hi>grand Covenant of Grace</hi> was made with Jeſus Chriſt, and us in him, and is <hi>eſſentially</hi> one in all times; ſo as no one of thoſe federal expreſſures <hi>to Adam</hi> fallen, <hi>or to Abraham, or to David,</hi> can rightly be deemed the Covenant of Grace it ſelf (unleſs ſummarily, or as an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome thereof) but only diſcoveries of ſome ſmall parcels and branches thereof, and differ from it, as a part from the whole, or as a particular Article from a whole federal tranſaction which conſiſteth of many more; yea that compriſeth all the Promiſes of furniſhing Jeſus Chriſt for the work, and rendring him proſperous and ſucceſsful in it, <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 53. ver. 10, 11, 12.)
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48981:65"/>
as well as Promiſes of what he will do for us, and one Article may be diſtinct enough from another: As among men, a Father by an Indenture (containing many Articles) may ſettle an inheritance upon his Son and his Poſterity, and all make up but one Covenant in the main; yet one Article may be diſtinct enough from another, and any one may be called a diſtinct Covenant, when it is compared with another; one Covenant may be concerning ſome condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be performed by the Son, another Covenant for the Father to acknowledge a Fine, or give a further aſſurance, another to free from incumbrances; So <hi>the great God</hi> ſettleth an everlaſting inheritance upon ſome of the Sons of men, by one <hi>grand Covenant of Grace</hi> made with Jeſus Chriſt as their <hi>Head,</hi> which hath many Articles and matters belonging to it, diſtinct enough each from other; as, <hi>one Covenant</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>a condition</hi> to be performed by men in their ſurety Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>this is that as Mount</hi> Sinai; <hi>another Covenant</hi> concerning the <hi>priviledges</hi> which ſhall be afforded by him, that condition being performed, this is the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> Jer. 31. verſ. 31. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the daies come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a New Covenant—</hi>Here is a Covenant to give further aſſurance and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48981:65"/>
of what; and thus although the grand Covenant be but one, yet theſe ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles thereof compared each with other, are clearly enough diſtinct, and ſo that <hi>at</hi> Sinai <hi>and the New are two Covenants;</hi> as may appear theſe wales.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant is denied to be made before Iſraels coming out of</hi> Egypt; <hi>and therefore muſt be diſtinct, or another Covenant from that which promiſed ſpecial bleſſings in Chriſt;</hi> For, that was made with the Patriarchs, as <hi>Abraham, Iſrae,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. long before Iſraels deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. verſ. 1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.

He ſpeaketh <hi>not</hi> of the <hi>moral Law</hi> barely as a Rule of Life, for ſo, even before <hi>Abraham</hi> it was; immortalities were ever ſinful, and expoſed thoſe that were guilty of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48981:66"/>
them unto dreadful Judgements, as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> to fire and brimſtone, and the old World to a deluge of Water; therefore he muſt ſpeak of the <hi>Law</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered <hi>as a Covenant given at Mount</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai, and thus it was not till four hundred and thirty years after that with <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; ſo theſe muſt be <hi>two diſtinct Covenants</hi> of vaſtly different dates, elſe the Apoſtles ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which is built upon their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in reſpect of time, is not cogent, it is of no force, if they be of the ſame date, one as early as the other; for the falſe Apoſtles among the <hi>Galatians</hi> might have ſaid, the Law as a Covenant was as early as <hi>Abraham,</hi> for ſubſtance, though not for form and adminiſtration; this had been enough to elude his plea, which was grounded upon the time of it; eſpecially ſeeing <hi>the Law</hi> was urged amongſt the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> not meerly as to any <hi>circumſtances</hi> in that <hi>new miniſtration,</hi> but as to the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of it; the queſtion then being, <hi>Whether Juſtification and the eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance were by the works of the Law, or by Grace, and in a way of Faith?</hi> The Apoſtle argueth that this federal tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion at <hi>Sinai,</hi> not having a being till <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo long after that with <hi>Abraham;</hi> hence it could not eſtabliſh another way of life

               <p>O then let Chriſtians beware of mixing and confounding the Old and New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which are ſo diſtinct.

               <p>The falſe Prophets were ready to be branding <hi>Paul</hi> for an <hi>Antinomian;</hi> as if he rendred the Law unprofitable by his Preaching the Doctrine <hi>of free grace;</hi> for the taking off this aſperſion he putteth the queſtion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Wherefore then ſerveth the Law?</hi> that is, if the Law doth not, juſtifie, why then was it given? or what uſe was it of?

Where obſerve, how carefully the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth diſtinguiſh theſe: he doth not make the <hi>Sinai</hi> Law or Covenant one and the ſame with the Promiſe, but ſomething added or put to it, a diſtinct thing; it was additional, and ſo not the Promiſe it ſelf, but yet was of admirable uſe, it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>[becauſe of tranſgreſſion]</hi> ſay ſome, to reveal and diſcover ſin, and lay reſtraint upon men that they run not into it; but the Law in the hand of Chriſt is of ſuch uſe to Believers ſtill; whereas he ſpeaketh of ſuch a uſe of it as laſteth only till the <hi>coming</hi> of the <hi>promiſed Seed;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I underſtand it thus <hi>[becauſe or for the ſake of tranſgreſſion]</hi> viz. that Jeſus Chriſt by coming under it might make full ſatisfaction for that tranſgreſſion which man was in: it was added <hi>not</hi> for <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but</hi> for <hi>tranſgreſſions ſake,</hi> that its curſe might be indured and removed, and this additional uſe of the Law, was but <hi>till the promiſed ſeed came,</hi> then it ceaſed, having its accompliſhment in him: the Law was added that he might <hi>finiſh tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and make an end of ſin,</hi> as Dan. 9. 24. And this way was made, for the <hi>Divine Promiſe</hi> to paſs upon us.</p>
               <p>Now there is a <hi>ſinful mixing theſe two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, the Old and the New,</hi> which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,</p>

1. <hi>When there is a joyning any thing of ours with Jeſus Chriſt in the matter of acceptation unto eternal Life:</hi> this was the caſe of thoſe Judaizing Prophets, <hi>Act.</hi> 15 1. they taught <hi>[except ye be circumciſed after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of</hi> Moſes, <hi>ye cannot be ſaved].</hi> The like we have, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>If ye be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi> They expected advantage by Jeſus Chriſt, elſe this Argument would have been of no force to them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Chriſt is of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to you,</hi> &amp;c. They were therefore jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling works of their own, and Jeſus Chriſt together, mixing theſe in the matter of their <hi>acceptation unto Life,</hi> and this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated to be deſperately dangerous.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians ought to perform all duty in conformity to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>in the way to Salvation,</hi> but <hi>not</hi> in the leaſt <hi>or that which juſtifieth or ſaveth.</hi> See what earneſtneſs and vehemency the Apoſtle uſeth herein, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>I teſtifie again to every man that is circumciſed that he is a debtor to the whole Law.</hi> Where is intimated, that an acting in any work upon a <hi>legal</hi> account, or on <hi>a legal</hi> ground, is a putting our ſelves under the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, and is all one as if we ſought life altogether by, the <hi>Law;</hi> For, if they were <hi>circumciſed</hi> upon a principle or opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of its conducing to their <hi>Juſtification,</hi> they became debtors thereby to the <hi>whole Law:</hi> though they did not think other ſervices required or themſelves obliged to them, yet by one, they put themſelves under the bond of the whole. Thus then, if any ſhould act in any Goſpel Inſtitutions as Baptiſme, or the Supper of the Lord upon a like account as they did take up circumciſion, <hi>viz.</hi> with an opinion of their conducing to <hi>juſtification and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> with God unto Eternal Life, they would thereby make themſelves debtors to the whole Law: So if they ſhould give <hi>Repentance, mourning for ſin, ſelf-empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yea Faith it ſelf,</hi> the ſame place, and act therein upon ſuch a ground as they did in <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> Chriſt would be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of no effect unto ſuch Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When there is a living in the Spirit of the Old Covenant, in dealing with the Promiſes of the New; then indeed there is a mixing of the two Covenants which are ſo diſtinct:</hi> The Old Covenant car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with it a Spirit of bondage and terrour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 18.

               </p>

                  <p>Prop. I. <hi>The</hi> Sinai <hi>Law was not given as a Covenant of Works to</hi> Iſrael.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[A Covenant of Works] requireth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect perſonal obedience, promiſing life or a reward of Juſtice thereupon, and threatning death upon the leaſt violation thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is evident from the Covenant <hi>with Adam</hi> in innocency, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. He obeying, it is implied he ſhould live; he diſobeying by eating the forbidden Fruit; the ſentence of death paſſeth upon him: and apparently this is a true deſcription of a Covenant of Works, for whatever is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite unto this, ſpeaketh <hi>Grace:</hi> if <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Eternal Life</hi> be attained by <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers righteouſneſs or obedience</hi> (without

their perſonal performance of it) there is <hi>Grace</hi> herein; if the reward be <hi>not of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> it muſt be of <hi>Grace;</hi> if <hi>imperfections</hi> and ſinful failings be not followed with death, there is <hi>Grace</hi> in that alſo.</p>
                  <p>Now the deſign or intendment of God in giving the <hi>Sinai Covenant,</hi> was <hi>not,</hi> that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould by their own obedience obtain Eternal Life and Salvation. Indeed <hi>the falſe Apoſtles</hi> in Goſpel times did put upon perſonal obedience, they urged <hi>Circumcifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and other works of the Law</hi> as neceſſary unto <hi>Juſtification and Eternal Life;</hi> but in oppoſition to them the Apoſtle argueth in diverſe Chapters in the Epiſtles to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> proving that they come by a righteouſneſs performed for us by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>Therefore by the deeds of the Law</hi> (i. e. as perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by themſelves) <hi>ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight;</hi> it is <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>Without the deeds of the Law,</hi> Gal. 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.

And leſt any ſhould think that this was only ſince the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant was at an end, the Apoſtle proveth that <hi>our works are now excluded</hi> from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> Rom. 4. verſ. 2, 3. <hi>For if</hi> Abraham <hi>were juſtified by works, he hath whereof to glory but not before God; and addeth,</hi> it is to him that <hi>worketh not,</hi> verſ. 5. and verſ. 6. <hi>Even as</hi> David <hi>alſo deſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of the man unto whom God imputeth righteouſneſs without works:</hi> Where it is plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, that we are <hi>juſtified</hi> in Goſpel times in the ſame <hi>way for ſubſtance</hi> with them <hi>of old,</hi> and he expreſly ſaith, that this was not by works of their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; no not by ſuch as they came up to, <hi>after</hi> they were in <hi>a ſtate of grace,</hi> much leſs by any works of theirs <hi>before</hi> they did <hi>believe,</hi> elſe the Apoſtles argument were not cogent; for the falſe Prophets might eaſily have anſwered, that now in Goſpel times we are not juſtified as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were, and ſo they might have waved whatever is urged from theſe inſtances; ſeeing all that he ſaith is built upon this very foundation, <hi>that we are juſtified as they were:</hi> only this can hardly be evaded, that <hi>David (who lived under the</hi> Sinai <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant)</hi>

yet is <hi>denied</hi> to be <hi>juſtified by works</hi> of his own. Yea the Apoſtle excludeth them even from <hi>the nature of a Covenant of works;</hi> which is ſuch a ground as denieth lapſed man in any Age to be ſaved by his own obedience, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt.</hi> Therefore unleſs it could be ſaid that thoſe under the <hi>Sinai Law</hi> had Eternal Life, <hi>not of grace but of debt,</hi> it muſt be ſaid that they had it <hi>not</hi> in the way of <hi>a Covenant of works.</hi>

There was abundance of the Goſpel wrapt up in thoſe legal Types and ſhaddows of old.</p>
                  <p>There were <hi>Prieſts and a High-Prieſt</hi> an eminent Type <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is therefore called <hi>a High-Prieſt</hi> alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 1. and elſe-where.</p>
                  <p>O what an advantage was it ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt, to have ſuch a lively Emblem of this his <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Office,</hi> which our everlaſting Salvation had ſuch a neceſſary dependance upon That as the Levitical High-Prieſt did ſtand and appear for the People, in many waies and for many precious ends that none elſe could; ſo they might expect that Jeſus Chriſt would do the like for them.

                  <p>Many ſuppoſe that this was only a ſede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tranſaction with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo as that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which is <hi>the condition of the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant,</hi> (on which all the bleſſings of it do depend) is nothing elſe but the ſame which is to be yielded by us in Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel times, only then it was exacted with dreadful terrours, thundrings and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, now in a ſweeter milder way; but certainly a higher matter, a perfect obedience is aimed at therein. It is true, Chriſtians are obliged unto all duty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the better Covenant; there is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in it of writing <hi>the Divine Law in their hearts</hi> for that end. All the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then in the <hi>Sinai</hi> diſpenſation ariſeth not meerly from its injoyning doing (all runs upon doing there, not upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving) but alſo from its annexing life thereunto <hi>[this do and Live]</hi> and <hi>a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48981:82"/>
curſe</hi> to the contrary. If it had contained all <hi>the Laws</hi> that are in it, even all <hi>the ceremonials,</hi> theſe indeed would have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it more burdenſom than other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, yet it would as manifeſtly have belonged to the Covenant of Grace ſtill, as that with <hi>Abraham</hi> and others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which were ſome Sacrifices and other Typical ceremonies. If this doing had not been for Life, there had been no more difficulty in this <hi>Sinai Law</hi> than in any other ſederal expreſſure; its running up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>[do and Live]</hi> this hath cauſed many to doubt of the nature of it; and therefore the great matter to be cleared is, upon what account it ſtandeth in this form? and this will evidence, that though there was <hi>an adminiſtration of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace in it to</hi> Iſrael; yet there was a higher intendment therein, <hi>viz.</hi> a performance of it by Jeſus Chriſt for impetration or the procurement of ſede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bleſſings for us; and therefore that it was not only a gradually different admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from the other New Covenant to us.

                  <p>In <hi>one and the ſame</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant,</hi> the All-wiſe God exacted <hi>a double obedience,</hi> for vaſtly different ends, <hi>viz. a perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to be performed by Jeſus Chriſt, as the <hi>legal condition</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, as the principal end: and alſo <hi>an obedience</hi> to be performed by <hi>Iſrael</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of it, in order to their fruition of temporal injoyments: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this latter the former is repreſented.

                  <p>The <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant did not intend only an obedience to be performed by <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but alſo a further and higher Obedience to be yielded by Jeſus Chriſt.

1. <hi>The</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant exacteth a perfect obedience which maketh up a righteouſneſs unto Life, and therefore was the legal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant of Grace to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Jeſus Chriſt alone;</hi> for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that <hi>Iſrael</hi> or any of the Sons of men ſhould perform ſuch a perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for themſelves, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, verſ. 21. and ſo they muſt miſs of Eternal Life, if he did not perform it for them.</p>
                  <p>That ſuch a perfect obedience is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſibly required in the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant as a condition of Life is evident, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. verſ. 5. compared with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. verſ. 10, 12. it is ſuch as ſtandeth upon oppoſite terms to Faith, and is impoſſible for any man to perform, as I have proved, and ſuch as is a righteouſneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. verſ. 25. <hi>And it ſhall be our righteouſneſs, if we obſerve to do all theſe Commandments, before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. verſ. 5. he evidently determineth that the <hi>Sinai</hi> Law impoſeth that doing which amounteth to a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs unto Life, and muſt be a perfect obedience which man is utterly unable to yield for himſelf: and therefore admirably to our preſent purpoſe it is added, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>For Chriſt is the end of the Law for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to every one that believeth.</hi>

                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:48981:86"/>
This intimateth, that <hi>the Law hath an end</hi> to be attained, and that is <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> performeth it, he becometh that <hi>end</hi> of it to believers; not only <hi>accidentally and indirectly</hi> as the Law diſcovereth duty impoſſible for any man to perform, and a neceſſity of looking to another for relief; but <hi>directly,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt hath wrought out and fulfilled that righteouſneſs which the Law exacted, and ſo is <hi>the end of the Law;</hi> For, it is here oppoſed unto that righteouſneſs which is of a mans own working out, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>We muſt know, that when <hi>Adam</hi> was in innocency, the Lord required a perfect fulfilling of the Law, in order to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in life, and now man is in a fallen eſtate, the Lord will abate nothing of it; ſtill <hi>without a righteouſneſs ſpecifically the ſome, no Eternal Life to be had.</hi> (Rom. 1. <hi>urſ.</hi> 17. Rom. 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. and 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 18, 21. 2 Cor. 3. 9, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> That end of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> righteouſneſs, muſt ſtill be come up to; only under <hi>the Covenant of Works, man</hi> was perſonally to perform it for himſelf, but now <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to work out this perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law for him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. verſ. 18, 19. <hi>By the obedience of one</hi> (i. e. of Jeſus Chiſt) <hi>many are made righteous.</hi> Hence

                  <p>Nothing can more fully expreſs the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Covenant of Works than this; that with <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency cannot be one, if this be not ſo; For, there is no more in that then, [if thou Eateſt thou ſhalt Die], and there is as much here [if thou doſt not all thou ſhalt be Curſed]: and yet the Apoſtle is not ſpeaking here, of the very Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, but of one in the matter of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling that, made a long time after, even at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> For, he ſaith, <hi>it is written thus;</hi> now it is <hi>in Moſes Law</hi> (long after <hi>Adam)</hi> that this was written; <hi>viz.

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt by coming under, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant, did work out Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for us,</hi> and therefore <hi>that did hold forth not only an obedience to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by</hi> Iſrael, <hi>but alſo ſuch as was a legal condition of the Covenant of Grace to be performed by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> For, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that whereby we are redeemed, was not any work of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem themſelves or us) but a work of Jeſus Chriſt, anſwering the demand of the Covenant of Grace which is for Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. verſ. 4, 5. <hi>God ſent his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law, to Redeem them that were under the Law—</hi>He ſpeaketh of <hi>that Law</hi> by which they were held <hi>in bondage</hi> before the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>Indeed, I think, <hi>one great end</hi> of God in bringing <hi>Iſrael</hi> under this <hi>Sinai Covenant,</hi> was to make way for <hi>Chriſt</hi> his being <hi>born or made</hi> under the Law, in order to the fulfilling of it for us. I do not ſee how (by any viſible diſpenſation) <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> could have been <hi>born actually under the Law,</hi> if this <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> had not been made; For, <hi>the Covenant of Works</hi> with the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> being violated, it was at an end as to <hi>the promiſing part,</hi> it promiſed nothing after once it was broken; it remained in force only as to its <hi>threatning part,</hi> it me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced <hi>Death</hi> to all the <hi>ſinful ſeed</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> but admitted no other into it who were <hi>without ſin,</hi> either to perform the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of it, or to anſwer the penalty; <hi>it had nothing to do with an innocent perſon after broken,</hi> for it was <hi>never renewed</hi> with man again as before: therefore an admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>an innocent perſon (as Jeſus Chriſt was)</hi> into it, muſt be by ſome kind of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48981:89"/>
                     <hi>repetition or renewing of it,</hi> though with other intendments than at firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that the guilty perſons ſhould not fulfill it for themſelves, but that another, <hi>a ſurety</hi> ſhould fulfill it for them.</p>
                  <p>Some <hi>medium or means</hi> there muſt be, whereby this innocent perſon Jeſus Chriſt might be taken into it, and come under the <hi>very ſame Law</hi> that was broken to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the righteouſneſs, and ſatisfie or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the penalty, which the Lord ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired without <hi>ſubſtantial abatement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in infinite wiſdom, the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived <hi>this way of the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Iſrael</hi> (who were guilty) by <hi>voluntary compact and agreement,</hi> obliged themſelves and their Seed to the perfect obedience which the Law required, and that under pain of the <hi>Curſe; and Jeſus Chriſt being born of their Seed, and under the</hi> Sinai <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation or Covenant, was born under the ſame Law, which the guilty perſons were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in:</hi> I ſee not how that could have been, though he had been born of the Seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> without this renewing of it at mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he had not been born under the <hi>very Law as a Covenant of Works,</hi> he ſhould not have ſatisfied it, by anſwering the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty or fulfilling the righteouſneſs of it,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48981:90"/>
but had only done and ſuffered ſomething <hi>in lieu and ſtead thereof,</hi> it would <hi>not</hi> have been the <hi>idem</hi> for us; and this ſheweth how exceedingly neceſſary the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant was.</p>
                  <p>It is true, <hi>there was an agreement between the Father and the Son from Eternity about it, the Covenant of Grace was then ſtruck</hi> and had a being; but <hi>the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant</hi> was a neceſſary <hi>medium or means</hi> for the <hi>execution</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt actually underwent the very Curſe of the</hi> Sinai <hi>Law, ſo as thereby he hath obtained our freedom from it,</hi> and therefore <hi>that held forth the legal condition of the Covenant of Grace, to be performed by him on our behalf:</hi> how elſe ſhould his undergoing the <hi>Sinai</hi> Curſe, give us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity from it?</p>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48981:90"/>
the very <hi>Sinai Curſe,</hi> that we might be delivered from it. And the ſcope of the Apoſtle here is, to diſcover how we attain unto <hi>Juſtification and Eternal Life,</hi> it is <hi>by Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his <hi>Redeeming</hi> of us from the Curſe of the Law; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his bearing of it is <hi>the condition of our Salvation</hi> as to <hi>penalty,</hi> even <hi>as his active obedience</hi> is the <hi>condition</hi> of it as to <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And let it be obſerved, theſe <hi>Galatians</hi> were <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and yet before their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they were under the <hi>Curſe</hi> mentioned in <hi>the Sinai Covenant,</hi> and needed to be <hi>Redeemed</hi> from it by Jeſus Chriſt, as well as <hi>Jews,</hi> though the <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> was made only with the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were <hi>never formally</hi> under it; that expired as a Covenant before the converſion of the <hi>Galatians, Gal.</hi> 3. verſ. 13. and 14. verſ. 21. and 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. Jeſus Chriſt did bear the Curſe, not to prevent theſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> coming under it, but <hi>to Redeem</hi> them from it.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>in the</hi> Sinai <hi>diſpenſation</hi> was contained <hi>the condition</hi> of <hi>the Covenant of Grace,</hi> which <hi>Gentiles</hi> were concerned in, as well as <hi>Jews.</hi>

                  <p>But let them know, that <hi>Iſraels obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> injoyned therein, was not only about <hi>Morals,</hi> but alſo about <hi>ceremonial ſervices,</hi> Levit. 18. 5. and 26. <hi>verſ.</hi> 46. his Statutes or Inſtitutions, which clearly typified <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> and that in his <hi>paſſive obedience,</hi> his ſhedding of his blood, which was the great requiſite to our Redemption and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, theſe were as much impoſed upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> as the other, and yet Jeſus Chriſt muſt be principally intended therein, ſo as <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not have any ſhare with him in making the leaſt ſatisfaction for ſin by all thoſe Sacrifices, Offerings, and ſheddings of Blood; therein Chriſt was alone and there was none with him.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were obliged <hi>Typically,</hi> by their Prieſts to offer Sacrifices for ſin and make attonement, upon pain of the Curſe, and to do many ſuch acts that did bear ſome relation to the paſſive obedience of Jeſus Chriſt, but yet Jeſus Chriſt alone was the real attonement. It is certain the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> by their own works ſhould attain Eternal Life. And ſeeing both the <hi>ceremonials and morals,</hi> are in <hi>the ſame manner</hi> urged upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the <hi>Sinai Covenant,</hi> and ſeeing alſo, ſuch
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48981:92"/>
an obedience to <hi>the Moral Law</hi> was unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably performed by Jeſus Chriſt as <hi>our righteouſneſs;</hi> hence all the inconveniencies that lie againſt the one for expreſſing the condition of the Covenant of Grace, do alſo lie againſt the other, where yet it muſt be acknowledged.</p>
                  <p>If any will yet urge, that <hi>the Sinai Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> was between <hi>God and Iſrael, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that <hi>in Old Teſtament times,</hi> things were expreſſed very <hi>darkly,</hi> and ſeemed at the firſt bluſh to have relation only to ſome <hi>lower matters,</hi> theſe were moſt obvious, when other <hi>higher things</hi> were principally intended in them.</p>
                  <p>Thus, many paſſages to outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ſeem to relate only to <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Solomon</hi> (who indeed had their ſhare in them) but yet they were <hi>Prophetical or Typical of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and under them he <hi>was principally intended,</hi> as the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting and applying of them to him doth frequently evidence, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. verſ. 10. compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 2. verſ. 31. and 13. verſ. 35. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. verſ. 18. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. verſ. 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. verſ. 36. with <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. verſ. 32, 33. So in like manner <hi>in the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant</hi> (which was a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation full of darkneſs noted by the vailing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48981:92"/>
of the face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. <hi>Iſraels obedience</hi> is required for its due and proper end, but yet under that, <hi>the perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Jeſus Chriſt is principally intended, for a higher end,</hi> viz. <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> for it is applyed unto Chriſt, and the fulfilling of the Law and delivering us from it, is aſcribed unto him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>The great difficulties about this</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant vaniſh, if we underſtand it prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily of the legal condition of the Covenant of Grace to be performed by Jeſus Chriſt, and any other way they will hardly be removed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The tenour of it, plainly is <hi>[Do and Live, and Curſed is he that doth not]</hi> here lieth the difficult of it.</p>
                  <p>Hence, <hi>on the one hand, ſome account that at</hi> Sinai, <hi>a Covenant of Works to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and deny it to be a Covenant of Grace or to belong to that, it requiring perfect obedience and not diſpenſing with one offence,</hi> Gal. 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>There being a Curſe annexed to the breaking of it, as a bleſſing to the keeping of it, even to doing,</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>The Seed of it being out-caſts,</hi> Gal. 4. <hi>the latter end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>all ſuch Objections melt away,</hi> if we underſtand it of <hi>the Covenant of Grace as to its legal condition,</hi> to be fulfilled by our <hi>Surely: immediately</hi> it was thus Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted <hi>by Iſrael,</hi> but <hi>terminatively</hi> it looked
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48981:93"/>
at a performance <hi>by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that he ſhould be <hi>the only doer for Life;</hi> and thus a perfect doing was aimed at in the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, and thus it was perfectly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by Jeſus Chriſt, no offence diſpenced with, the Curſe fully undergone by him, and they that crowd into the place of Jeſus Chriſt in it, and would fulfill it for that end he did, even for Eternal Life, they are the Seed which are the out-caſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>On the other hand, ſome aſſert the</hi> Sinai <hi>diſpenſation to be an admiſtration of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace only gradually or acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, and in ſome circumſtances differing from other federal expreſſures, even from the New Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas, all the bleſſings of the <hi>New,</hi> are promiſed as precious Fruits and effects of a pre-ſuppoſed accompliſhment of the <hi>Old</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſie to diſcover the invalidity of other interpretations of <hi>[Do and Live]</hi> in the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, which confine the Doing to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and do not extend it pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily to Jeſus Chriſt. As,</p>
                  <p>Say ſome, it is <hi>not</hi> ſpoken of <hi>the Law abſtractly and ſeparately conſidered, but of the Law and the Promiſe joyntly, or as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Promiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this doth not ſatisfie, for the Apoſtle
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48981:93"/>
ſaith, <hi>the Law is not of Faith,</hi> Gal. 3. verſ. 12. and addeth, <hi>but the man that doth them, ſhall live in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore the Law ſpeaketh of ſuch a doing for Life, as doth not include <hi>the Promiſe,</hi> for then it ſhould be <hi>of Faith.</hi> Nay plainly it is <hi>a doing directly oppoſite to believing, in the matter of Juſtification and Life,</hi> Levit. 18. verſ. 5. with Rom. 10. verſ. 5, 6. Gal. 3. verſ. 12. <hi>viz.</hi> if any men undertake to be the Doers.</p>
                  <p>Say others, <hi>it is not Do and Live [by Doing] but [in Doing]; Chriſtians live in obedience, though not by obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this doth not ſatisfie; For, it is <hi>ſuch a doing</hi> as maketh up <hi>a righteouſneſs unto Life, and is contradiſtinguiſhed from the righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> Rom. 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6. and hence it cannot be meant only of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere or Evangelical obedience to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Chriſtians at all times, but vaſtly differeth therefrom.</p>
                  <p>Say others, <hi>This Do and Live hath not reference to the Moral Law only, but to the Ceremonial alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither doth this ſatisfie, for there is no ground to exclude <hi>the Moral Law;</hi> it was ſuch a Law as concluded <hi>all under ſin,</hi> Gal. 3. 22. Beſides, the difficulty is the ſame whether it be by one or the other.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48981:94"/>
If in <hi>[Do and Live] a ceremonial doing</hi> were intended for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that would ſpeak as much for its being a Covenant of Works <hi>as if it were a Moral doing;</hi> even that with <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency did run upon a Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precept concerning Eating or not Eating that Fruit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. verſ. 17.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth the Lord here make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the Covenant of Works <hi>to put them upon their choice,</hi> whether they would be ſaved by Working or Believing; For, they were already within the Covenant of Grace, and had the Lord for their God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 1. And doubtleſs the Lord would not leave them to a liberty to go back from that Grace, much leſs would he enter into ſuch a ſolemn Covenant (as that at <hi>Sinai</hi> was) with them, for that end to open a door for their croſſing his grand deſign of free Grace.</p>
                  <p>Say others, <hi>If we look upon the Law ſeparately, ſo it ſtandeth upon oppoſite terms, but if you look upon it relatively as it hath reſpect to the Promiſe, ſo thoſe oppoſite terms have their ſubſervient ends to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and Grace, convincing of our ſin and impotency,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Law conſidered abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in it ſelf, as</hi> Gal. 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 21, to the end, <hi>ſo it is nothing elſe but a Covenant of Works; but conſidered reſpectively and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relatively,</hi>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:48981:94"/>
as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. verſ. 17. to <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. verſ. 21. <hi>and ſo it is not a Covenant of Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, it is true that the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant was deſigned for the ends of the Covenant of Grace, or of the Goſpel; for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle putting the Queſtion, <hi>Is the Law againſt the Promiſe?</hi> Gal. 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. He An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, God forbid; we muſt then ſo underſtand the <hi>Sinai</hi> Law, as in reſpect of its deſign and end it may not be againſt the Promiſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>The Law was our School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter until Chriſt,</hi> yet it was for a Goſpel end, not that we might be juſtified by the Law, but <hi>that we might be juſtified by Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſtill the difficulty remaineth, in that, ſeparately and abſolutely conſidered, it is the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, and runneth upon <hi>Do and Live.</hi> Yea, <hi>it gendreth to bondage,</hi> Gal. 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. Even as it is <hi>the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant.</hi> It would not conduce to thoſe ends, the convincing of ſin, humbling for it, exciting to believing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But by its own inability for the getting of Life, and the avoiding of the Curſe, as Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that way; it is therefore preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as ſuch a Covenant before its uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to theſe ends. Neither can we imagine that the great God would trifle
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48981:95"/>
with men in entring into ſuch a ſolemn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them on thoſe terms <hi>[Do and live]</hi> if there muſt not be this very doing here intended by ſome or other, or elſe no life to be attained: and it is <hi>perfect doing</hi> that is called for, as I have proved, which could not be fulfilled by <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were utterly unable for it; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. and therefore it is a doing by Jeſus Chriſt for them that is there intended.</p>
                  <p>Say others, <hi>The Law is taken largely, for the whole Doctr
ine and Adminiſtration of the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant, and ſo it holdeth forth life upon believing in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 10. verſ. 4. Gal. 3. verſ. 23, 24. <hi>and is a Covenant of faith; or it is taken ſtrictly, as it is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted rule of righteouſneſs conſiſting in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, Threatnings, and Promiſes holding forth life upon an impoſſible condition to lapſed man, perfect doing; in this ſenſe</hi> Moſes <hi>gave it not, nor is it a Covenant of faith but of works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this doth not ſatisfie, for, I ſee no ground for that large acceptation of the Law. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. ſpeaketh <hi>of the Law for righteouſneſs,</hi> and ſo is taken as ſtrictly as <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. only it is ſaid to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Jeſus Chriſt, and then by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſouls are intereſſed in his performance, and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 23, 24. he ſpeaketh of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48981:95"/>
the Law as a Schoolmaſter to Chriſt, which we are not under. Beſides, <hi>the Law</hi> in that ſtrict ſenſe (wherein this Objection granteth it to be a Covenant of Works) is that in which it was given at <hi>Sinai.</hi> Rom. 10. verſ. 5. <hi>[Moſes] deſcribeth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Law—he that doth them ſhall live in them.</hi> Therefore the Law was given in that reſtrained ſenſe by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, in that large acception it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved to be cloathed with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Covenant; whatever in that, is of a foederal nature, or can belong to it as a Covenan, trunneth upon the terms of that perfect Obedience, in that ſtrict ſenſe <hi>[Do and Live]</hi> and ſo apparently it putteth on the Nature even of <hi>a Covenant of Works,</hi> though not intended to be performed by <hi>Iſrael</hi> for life, but by Jeſus Chriſt for them.</p>

                  <p>Yea, not only <hi>external,</hi> viz. that of the outward man, but <hi>cordial</hi> obedience is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to this end: Deut. 11. verſ. 13. <hi>If ye will hearken diligently to my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I command you this day [to love the Lord your God, and to ſerve him with all your heart, and with all your ſoul.]</hi> Then, verſ. 14. <hi>I will give you the rain of your land,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſend graſs,</hi> &amp;c. outward mercies.

                  <p>This providing a relief, <hi>a remedy,</hi> doth imply, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> would fail, would ſin and ſtand in need of that <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> which in many caſes was here promiſed; yet in purſuance of theſe directions (which are punctually given by the Lord) <hi>in offering ſacrifices</hi> exactly according to appointment they <hi>ſhould be forgiven,</hi> that is, ſo far as <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral judgements threatned</hi> ſhould be <hi>avert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and <hi>temporal mercies promiſed</hi> ſhould be <hi>afforded:</hi> theſe ſins ſhould not be any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance in the way of them: thus far it was <hi>a real forgiveneſs,</hi> for if there had been no real expiation by thoſe ſacrifices <hi>and ſomething forgiven,</hi> how could they have been <hi>typical</hi> of that forgiveneſs which Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have of their ſins, by the true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice Jeſus Chriſt?

                  <p>And let it be obſerved, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh not in relation <hi>to temporals, but to eternals,</hi> then he mentioneth the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the ſame <hi>Sinai Law</hi> to be <hi>[Do and

                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>as to Temporals</hi> it was otherwiſe; although theſe were promiſed in <hi>the Sinai Covenant</hi> upon condition of <hi>Iſraels perfect obedience,</hi> yet when there was coming ſhort
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48981:98"/>
of it, and ſo a forfeiting them, yet there was proviſion made for the forgiveneſs of many ſins, ſo as the Lord would not take the forfeiture, or deal with them upon ſuch ſtrict terms as in <hi>the Covenant of Works,</hi> for in caſe they duly offored ſacrifices, they ſhould not loſe <hi>their temporal mercies:</hi> and thus it was <hi>an adminiſtration with ſome grace in it unto</hi> Iſrael. This appeareth theſe ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Laws and Ordinances for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip of God among the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were contained in the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant as part of its Condition,</hi> and therefore <hi>it did belong to the adminiſtration of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace:</hi> there is a deſcription of the Tabernacle which was for the worſhip of God <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. and in <hi>Levitieus;</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſacrifices and ſervices are required of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> burnt offerings, treſpaſs offerings, peace offerings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Rules and directions left by the Lord, muſt be exactly purſued by them, in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places at their utmoſt peril that they die not or be not cut off. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. <hi>verſ.</hi> 35. <hi>&amp;</hi> 30. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20, 21, 33. <hi>Levit.</hi> 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> 21, 25, 27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 9. and many others.</p>
                  <p>The Lord would never ſo punctually have laid out the way of his worſhip, if he had not intended that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould find
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48981:99"/>
acceptation, in keeping cloſe to him in thoſe his appointments. The free-will offering muſt be brought <hi>to the door of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi> Lev. 1. verſ. 3, 4. <hi>and it ſhall be accepted for him, i. e.</hi> for him that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, he ſhall have acceptance with the Lord to ſome end; and many of thoſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial ſervices are ſaid to be <hi>[for a ſweet ſavour unto the Lord]</hi> Lev. 4. verſ. 31. &amp; 6. verſ. 15. &amp; 23. verſ. 18. which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth their acceptation with God in thoſe acts of worſhip, at leaſt to the affording promiſed temporals, and ſo ſpeak their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the adminiſtration of the Covenant of grace, for ſinners cannot be accepted but in that way of grace in any ſervice; yea the Lord owned them with eminent tokens of his preſence when they duly acted therein, Lev. 9. verſ. 23. <hi>The glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Iſraels obedience was not to be that righteouſneſs which was the procuring cauſe of thoſe temporal bleſſings promiſed in the</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai <hi>Covenant,</hi> and therefore <hi>that was an adminiſtration of grace:</hi> the procurement even of thoſe was by the righteouſneſs of another, by the perfect obedience of Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore of grace.</p>
                  <p>In the Covenant of Works, man might
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48981:99"/>
have expected bleſſings for his own obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but it is otherwiſe in the <hi>Sinai</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation. Deut 9. verſ. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Speak not thou in thy heart,</hi> ſaying, <hi>for my righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs the Lord hath brought me in to poſſeſs this Land, but for the wickedneſs of theſe Nations the Lord doth drive them out from before thee,</hi> and again, verſ. 5. <hi>Not for thy righteouſneſs or the uprightneſs of thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. and a third time, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. The ſruition of <hi>Canaan</hi> was a great mercy <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant,</hi> and with what vehemency doth the Lord deny that it was afforded for the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> three times over he doth inculcate this, and therefore they muſt needs have it in a way of grace and favour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>There is an intimation in the</hi> Sinai <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of a proviſion made againſt the ſins and tranſgreſſions of perſons under it,</hi> and therefore <hi>it was an adminiſtration of grace:</hi> for a Covenant of Works revealeth no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or ſuccour in caſe of ſinning; nothing but death and a divine courſe is there to be expected. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
                  <p>But it was otherwiſe in the <hi>Sinai</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſhort of the obedience required therein, yet behold divine indulgence even in the bowels of that very Covenant, there
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48981:100"/>
is <hi>pardoning mercy</hi> repreſented in the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law: thus in caſe the Prieſt, the Rulers and the whole Congregation or any of the common people became guilty of ſins <hi>through ignorance,</hi> againſt any of the Commandments of the Lord, there was <hi>a ſin offering</hi> provided, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. <hi>through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi> and purſuing the directions therein, it is ſaid, <hi>they ſhall be forgiven, verſ.</hi> 20, 26, 31, 35. ſo in caſe of <hi>ſinning wittingly,</hi> there were <hi>treſpaſs offerings,</hi> Levit. 6. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo there were <hi>days of attonement and many waſhings;</hi> all which intimated that the Lord would not deal with them in a way of ſtrict juſtice according to the rigor of a Covenant of Works, and therefore that was to <hi>Iſrael</hi> a miniſtration of grace.</p>
                  <p>Indeed <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſtood under an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of reaping any temporal bleſſings by the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, if they had been held ſtrictly by the Lord to the condition of perfect obedience, without any way to be freed from their ſin; for, <hi>Iſrael</hi> could never have anſwered the condition of it, and ſo would have miſſed and come ſhort of all the good of it, and conſequently this Covenant for temporal bleſſings would have been vain and uſeleſs; which were an impeachment to the wiſdom of God the maker of it, to aſſert; there muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be grace in it.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:48981:100"/>
4. <hi>Conſiderations of mercy are made great inducements to the obedience of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant,</hi> and therefore <hi>it was an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of grace to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Covenant of Works runneth upon perfect obedience as the condition of it, urgeth duty in a way of Juſtice, as in that with <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, the inforcement to obedience was primarily the danger of failing thereof, viz. <hi>dying thou ſhalt die,</hi> Gen. 2. verſ. 17.</p>
                  <p>Or on the other hand the hope of a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of debt; Adam</hi> perfectly obeying, the Lord in juſtice would be obliged to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford what he had promiſed.</p>
                  <p>Whereas in the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, a grand motive and provocation to <hi>Iſraels</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was mercy: in the very preface to the Decalogue, Exod. 20. verſ. 2. <hi>I am the Lord thy God;</hi> that noteth Covenant intereſt in him, a choice mercy to a ſinful people; <hi>[which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage]</hi> there was mercy in their redemption, and this is mentioned to urge their obſervation of the following Commandments, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that <hi>covenant mercy and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy</hi> are grand <hi>arguments unto</hi> Iſraels <hi>obedience in this</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was grace in that miniſtration.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48981:101"/>
Likewiſe <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>Thou are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the people of the Lord thy God,</hi> here is their mercy, what improvement to be made of it? <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Thou ſhalt therefore obey the voice of the Lord thy God, and do his Commandments and his Statutes which I command thee this day.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. many Verſes, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. ver. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>No violation or breaking of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on</hi> Iſraels <hi>part, deprived them of thoſe temporal mercies promiſed, unleſs it were againſt the ſubſtantials of the</hi> Sinai <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> and therefore <hi>it was an adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace to</hi> Iſrael: for elſe every, even the leaſt ſin would have cut them ſhort of all the benefit thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now where the Lord ſpeaketh of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Covenant, it is in ſome principal matters thereof, as <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. verſ. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <p>If we view the inſtances or examples of the Lords plucking away thoſe temporal mercies from them, the Lord did not take advantage to do it upon every ſin of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but upon groſſer failures againſt the ſubſtance of the Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. ver. 3. <hi>The Lord deſtroyed them that followed</hi> Baal-Peor; there is judgement upon tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and in oppoſition to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God, are alive every one of you this day,</hi> ver. 5, 6. Thoſe that were in the firmeſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence unto God, yet were not ſinleſs; but the Lord doth intimate that he would not take advantage upon leffer ſins of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, to deal in ſuch a way of ſeverity with them, but upon greater miſcarriages; they that walked in a believing, careful, conſcientious obedience, were ſpared by the Lord as here he telleth us: ſo their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity and other ſcatterings out of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and deprivation of their <hi>temporal mercies,</hi> were upon their croſſing ſome <hi>main ends</hi> of that Covenant, and not otherwiſe, which argueth that there was <hi>Grace</hi> attending it unto <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

6. <hi>After a violation of the</hi> Smai <hi>Covenant by</hi> Iſrael, <hi>yet it admitted of Repentance, and promiſed a return of mercy,</hi> and therefore <hi>was an adminiſtration of Grace to them:</hi> Had it been a Covenant of Works to them, then no benefit could have been expected by it after a violation, whatever Repentance had ſucceeded.</p>
                  <p>But it was otherwiſe here, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. ver. 1, 2. when under <hi>ſcatterings among the Nations,</hi> then if <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>thou ſhalt return to the Lord thy God, and obey his voice with all thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Then the Lord thy God will turn thy Captivity, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion upon thee.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>And will bring thee into the Land which thy Fathers poſſeſſed, and thou ſhalt poſſoſs it, and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy Fathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When by their ſin they had forfeited their temporal mercies, yet on the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Repentance, they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs and reinjoy them; and therefore to <hi>Iſrael</hi> it was an adminiſtration of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But did not the Lord diſpence out Spiritual and Etennal mercies of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, by the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant, as well as temporals? if ſo, why is it menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as if it were only an adminiſtration of it to</hi> Iſrael <hi>for temporals?</hi>

Anſw. 1. <hi>Many perſons under the</hi> Sinai <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant did obtain Spiritual and Eternal mercies I freely grant;</hi> But whether theſe were diſpenced out by that, is queſtioned. <hi>Moſes</hi> and other <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were enriched with Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and were ſaved through the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, even as we, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. ver. 11. But they might injoy thoſe bleſſings by virtue of the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not by that at mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Under thoſe temporal things in the</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai <hi>Covenant, many Spiritual priviledges were typically repreſented:</hi> The dealings of the Lord with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in that diſpenſation, are ſaid to be as with an heir whilſt in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. ver. 1, 3. Now, Children in their minority, are led into apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of and affections to things by the Pictures of them, and are not ſo capable of right conceptions thereof other waies, and therefore a great deſign of the Lord in this <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant was, to Picture and point out many ſpiritual bleſſings unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> under theſe ſhaddows <hi>(Heb.</hi> 8. ver. 5.) for the drawing out that Faith which they had by the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> to be exerciſed about them; ſo as their Faith might be raiſed or helped by that at <hi>Sinai,</hi> though the bleſſings themſelves were not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48981:103"/>
diſpenced out thereby, but by that with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>The</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant muſt be conſidered either as holding forth the condition of the Covenant of Grace, and ſo it promiſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but upon a perfect obedience, and this not to be performed by</hi> Iſrael, <hi>but by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and thus as it could not give life by any obedience of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Gal. 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. Rom. 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. ſo neither did Jeſus Chriſt diſpence it out thereby, for he was the Mediatour of the New and better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and his miniſtration did lie there.</p>
                  <p>Or, <hi>we muſt conſider it as it was an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Covenant of Grace (though but a ſervile one) and the obedience thereof to be performed by</hi> Iſrael; and thus <hi>[it was added]</hi> Gal. 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 19. it was <hi>Additional or an Appendix</hi> to that with <hi>Abraham,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining many Precepts, Rules, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Divine appointment, as Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and other ceremonial ſervices relating to the Tabernacle, Prieſts, and External Worſhip of God, not before given forth, and ſo the perſons who were found in a due performance of theſe, with an eye upon and relation to the antient Promiſe, had many Spiritual bleſſings diſpenced out to them; but they might be only <hi>externally repreſented by the</hi> Siuai <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48981:103"/>
out</hi> by their looking from thence to that <hi>with Abraham,</hi> which it was annexed to, and to be taken in conjunction with.</p>
                  <p>I cannot think that the Lord would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their exerciſing themſelves about ſo many acts of Worſhip without intending that they ſhould injoy his Spiritual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and have acceptance in a due obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof.</p>
                  <p>Yea <hi>the temporal mercies</hi> themſelves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and afforded to them under the <hi>Sinai</hi> diſpenſation, were fruits <hi>of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace;</hi> no outward mercies can be injoyed by ſinful men in a federal way, but there muſt needs be Grace therein: And thus the matter cometh to the ſame reckoning, in many reſpects, whether thoſe ſpiritual priviledges were derived to them through the one Covenant or the other. I am far from thinking that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> injoyed only temporal mercies; doubtleſs they had Spiritual alſo, though poſſibly by another Covenant. But for the clearing of that <hi>Sinai</hi> diſpenſation, and preventing ſome ill effects (even in practice) of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding the nature thereof, I ſhall add,</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>It is probable that Spiritual and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal bleſſings were not diſpenced out to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>by the Old</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant, but only were
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48981:104"/>
typically repreſented therein.</hi> I take the main purport and deſign of it to be, under that ſervile adminiſtration of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, to point out the higher and more Spiritual matters thereof; and to ſhew, that as upon <hi>literal Iſraels</hi> perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the obedience which was required of them as a condition thereof, they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy <hi>temporal bleſſings</hi> therein promiſed to them; ſo upon the performance of the <hi>main condition</hi> thereof <hi>by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> even perfect obedience, <hi>the true Spiritual</hi> Iſrael ſhould enjoy <hi>the Spiritual bleſſings</hi> promiſed unto them. So that, <hi>Temporal bleſſings</hi> were afforded <hi>by the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant; but Spiritual bleſſings were not diſpenced out thereby.</hi> This (with ſubmiſſion to better Judgements) ſeemeth to me to be ſo upon theſe (among other) grounds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>No life was attainable by</hi> Iſraels <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other Spiritual bleſſings were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced out to them thereby,</hi> Gal. 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>For if there had been a Law given which could have given life, verily righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law.</hi> The great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings then of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>viz. life,</hi> could not be had by their obedience to the <hi>Sinai</hi> Law, of which he there ſpeaketh, <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. And therefore neither could other
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48981:104"/>
bleſſings be had thereby, which had their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon and iſſued from that. As Chriſtians are not now, ſo <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were not then to do for Life. That <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> muſt not enter into the Promiſed <hi>Canaan,</hi> but go up to the Mount and die, may be to ſignifie, that the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant would not give an entrance into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Canaan; Moſes</hi> obtained that, not through the works of the Law, but in a way of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Spiritual bleſſings were not diſpenced out upon the condition of</hi> Iſraels <hi>obedience to the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant, for they often violated that Covenant,</hi> Jer. 31. <hi>ver.</hi> 32. <hi>Which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant they brake—</hi>And therefore their Spiritual mercies had been forſeited and loſt, if they had been diſpenced out then upon the condition of their keeping that Covenant, ſeeing they come ſo much ſhort of it; whereas there was no falling from ſpecial Grace in that day, any more than now. When they had made a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of their temporal mercies therein Promiſed, by breaking of it, they were forced to make another plea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. ver. 13. <hi>Remember</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Iſrael <hi>thy Servants, to whom thou ſwareſt by thine own ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. When the anger of the Lord waxed hot againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ver. 11.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48981:105"/>
for committing Idolatry, by making the Calf; <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not plead that made at <hi>Sinai,</hi> but fleeth from that to <hi>the Covenant with</hi> Abraham for their relief.</p>
                  <p>Indeed there was <hi>an external repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirituals in the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant:</hi> As they making attonement, and offering Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices for diverſe ſins, it is ſaid they ſhould be forgiven them, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. ver. 26, 27, 28, 29, 31. <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. ver. 10, 13, 16, 18. <hi>Num.</hi> 15. ver. 28. But <hi>no real attonement</hi> was made thereby, for the Law made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing perfect <hi>(Heb.</hi> 7. ver. 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. ver. 9.) No real forgiveneſs was afforded by theſe acts of obedience, unleſs ſo far as that thoſe ſins ſhould not hinder their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the temporal mercies promiſed in that Covenant, or that the temporal Curſes of it ſhould not be inflicted; theſe did but <hi>typically repreſent the Spiritual forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which they by another Covenant (even that with <hi>Abraham)</hi> ſhould attain unto.</p>
                  <p>Thus their entring into Covenant with the Lord, is ſaid to be, that he might eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh them that day for a people to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that he might be unto them a God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. ver. 12, 13. They were thereby owned or confirmed in a federal relation unto God, but ſo as upon their
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48981:105"/>
miſcarriages he could ſay to them <hi>Loammi,</hi> Hoſ. 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Ye are not my people, and I will not be your God;</hi> and therefore it was <hi>externally only,</hi> that they were his, and he theirs by that Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The ceremonials which ſeemed moſt to intimate the diſpencing out of Spiritual bleſſings, were only typical repreſentations thereof:</hi> theſe were but <hi>ſhaddows of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things,</hi> Heb. 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. The forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin in the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant was ſuch as not to have temporal puniſhments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and thus it was but a ſhaddow of the real and true forgiveneſs, which in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition thereunto is reſtrained unto Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9, and 10. Chapters.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, whether ceaſed or continuing?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is Queſtioned by ſome, <hi>Whether the mount</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant be ſtill continuing, ſo as Chriſtians are laid under the obligation of it in Goſpel times?</hi> I may premiſe, that it is called <hi>[the Law]</hi> Mal. 4. 4. Rom. 7. and <hi>[a Covenant or Teſtament]</hi> Exod. 34. 23. Deut. 4. 13. Jer. 31. 31, 32. Gal. 4. 24.</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>The moral Law which was contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the</hi> Sinai <hi>diſpenſation is ſtill obliging;</hi> but conſider it <hi>as a Covenant or Teſtament,</hi> and ſo it is not continuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ceſſavit lex, ut norma eſt operum naturae ex formula foederis operum; manet vero iis qui in Chriſto ſunt, ut eſt regula operum gratiae,</hi> ſaith <hi>Rolloc. de Vocat.</hi> Cap. 2.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The moral Law as an external Rule of obedience, is univerſally and perpetually obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to the Sons of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some <hi>circumſtances,</hi> as the coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and prolonging the daies in the Land, <hi>i. e.</hi> in <hi>Canaan,</hi> Exod. 20. 2, 12. were <hi>peculiar to the Children of</hi> Iſrael: and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48981:107"/>
it is union with Jeſus and an internal vital principle, that all acceptable obedience no weth from, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5. but <hi>the ſubſtance of the ten Commandments is ſtill obliging.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The moral Law is a perfect rule of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and conformity to the Will of God,</hi> and therefore <hi>is perpetual.</hi> All good is commanded and all evil forbidden there, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. ver. 4. <hi>[Sin] is the tranſgreſſion of the Law.</hi> The very deſcription of ſin is fetched thence; that if we be bound not to ſin, then we are to keep the Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Remember the Law of</hi> Moſes; and this referreth to the times of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, when <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſs ariſeth with healing in his wings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed it is a repetition of the Law of Nature, which is ingraven upon the hearts of thoſe which are moſt barbarous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>The work of the Law is upon their hearts,</hi> and therefore ſo long as the Nature continueth, the obligation to the Law of it muſt alſo be continuing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 13. <hi>The Law is holy and the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holy juſt and good;</hi> whatſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is oppoſite to it, muſt be <hi>unholy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and evil.</hi> The ſame <hi>moral Law</hi> that was delivered <hi>at mount Sinai</hi> was (before and ſince) <hi>as it referred to the Free Promiſe,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48981:108"/>
a rule of inward holineſs, Sanctification and obedience, and had Spiritual injoyments attending of it: as it had relation to the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant and its end; ſo it uſhered in temporal mercies unto</hi> Iſrael.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lord hath declared his approbation of conformity to the moral Law, and with great ſeverity witneſſed againſt diſconformity to it in all Ages:</hi> Long before the <hi>Sinai</hi> miniſtration, <hi>Abel</hi> is commended for his Faith, owning and Worſhipping the true God, and <hi>Cain</hi> for the contrary diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. There was <hi>a reverend uſe of the Name of God,</hi> Gen. 14. 19, 20. <hi>The Sabbath Inſtituted,</hi> Gen. 2. 3. <hi>Superiours honoured,</hi> Gen. 9. 23. and 22. 7. <hi>Murther witneſſed againſt in</hi> Cain; <hi>Adultery and Unchaſtity puniſhed in raining Fire and Brimſtone on</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah; Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>reproved for bearing falſe witneſs,</hi> ſaying of <hi>Sarah, ſhe is my Siſter; Laban</hi> accuſed for <hi>defranding and coveting,</hi> Gen. 31. 7, 8, 9. So that though <hi>the wording of it</hi> in the <hi>formality of ten Commandments was at mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>yet immoralities were ever ſinful.</hi> Yea in the times of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament Jeſus Chriſt declareth his obſerving the waies, actings, and inclinations of men; and ſome are blamed, others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended even in his Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48981:108"/>
the leaſt ſwarvings from the rule are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Natural tendency of the moral Law is to promote love;</hi> Jeſus Chriſt himſelf is giving the Epitome and ſumm of the Law, and reduceth all the ten to two great Commandments, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. ver. 36. to 41. <hi>viz. Love to God and the Neighbour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doubtleſs men are obliged at all times to let the Streams of their Love run out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; to Love him with <hi>all their Heart, with all their Soul, with all their Mind, and to Love their Neighbours as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> and upon theſe two hang <hi>all the Law and Prophets,</hi> ver. 40. Yea the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of theſe is the keeping of the Law.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The moral Law is explained and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it earneſtly preſſed in the times of the Goſpel:</hi> to free it from the falſe gloſſes of the Jewiſh <hi>Rabbins,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf giveth an explication of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. declaring that not only groſſer acts are to be avoided, but whatſoever hath a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that way, <hi>unchaſt looks, unclean thoughts are ſinful,</hi> ver. 28. Chriſtians are under an obligation, not only to ſincere, but <hi>to perfect obedience unto the royal Law of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Jam. 1. 15. <hi>ſo as the leaſt failing of it it ſinful,</hi> though it doth not bring believers
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48981:109"/>
under condemnation. Yielding Worſhip to God is duty ſtill, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 10. as the way to withſtand Satan in his temptations, and the duties of the ſecond Table are plainly urged, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8. Love is undeniably a duty in Goſpel times, and the fulfilling of the Law is wrapt up in it, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, thou ſhalt not Steal, thou ſhalt not bear falſe Witneſs, thou ſhalt not Covet.</hi> Theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments then are in force ſtill, and the <hi>Romans</hi> (who were Chriſtians of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles) were under the obligation of them, and therefore they are perpetual. Yea, Jeſus Chriſt owneth them as his, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 10. <hi>If ye keep [my Commandments] ye ſhall abide in my Love,</hi> &amp;c. keeping theſe <hi>by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and loving one another,</hi> is the way to <hi>the manifeſtations of his Love:</hi> this of Love he calleth <hi>a new Commandment,</hi> Joh. 13. 34. Indeed this putteth ſweetneſs into it, Chriſtians are <hi>under the Law,</hi> but it is <hi>to Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 21. to their <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour,</hi> who ſatisfied for their breaking of it: they take it not from the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in its terrour and rigour, but from the hand of Jeſus Chriſt, who hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the curſe of it.</p>
               <p>The firſt Tables which were the work of God were quickly broken, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48981:109"/>
16, 19. but the ſecond Tables that were to be hewed by <hi>Moſes</hi> (a typical Mediatour) they were more durable, of longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and then the Lord proclaimeth his <hi>pardoning Mercy,</hi> Exod. 34. 1, 4, 6. The <hi>moral Law</hi> in the hand of Jeſus Chriſt the true <hi>Mediator,</hi> is <hi>abiding,</hi> and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace and mercy experienced under it. Of old the Ark of the Covenant had only the moral Law put into it, not the ceremonial <hi>(Deut.</hi> 10. 2.) to note, this was to be aboliſhed, but the Moral to abide with the Covenant ſtill; on which account it is promiſed of the New Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>I will write my Law in their Hearts:</hi> all which argue the perpetuity thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Mount</hi> Sinai <hi>diſpenſation as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is not continuing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is generally granted that it is abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in reſpect of ſome circumſtances, fruits and effects of it; as ſervile imbon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daging fear and ſuch like: but I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that <hi>none are under the obligation of it as a Covenant or Teſtament in Goſpel times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may appear theſe waies,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſucceſſion of the New Covenant in the room and ſtead of the Old, argue that it is not continuing:</hi> for one muſt be removed
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48981:110"/>
when another taketh its place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 21, 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>the new Covenant ſucceedeth the old:</hi> the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were apt to be doting upon that made at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> to take them off from it, he telleth them of a better come in the place and ſtead of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9. and obſerve the contradiſtinction is, <hi>between Covenant and Covenant, not barely between circumſtances and accidents of the ſame Covenant,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. in that he ſaith, <hi>a new Covenant, he hath made the firſt old, now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vaniſh away.</hi> It is <hi>the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> that is <hi>old,</hi> and the ſame is ſaid <hi>to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh away;</hi> and therefore it muſt needs be, that the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant ſhould ceaſe and come to an end, <hi>as</hi> Calvin <hi>ſaith, becauſe the ſecond is of another quality.</hi> It is true that the New Covenant in the ſubſtance of it or as a Covenant, is found in that with <hi>Abraham,</hi> though not under the notion of New, for that is given it in oppoſition to the Old; but it could not be ſaid to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, until the Old expired.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Ceremonial and Judicial Laws are generally granted to be abrogated, and ſo the old Covenant as to them</hi> (which make a conſiderable part of it) <hi>is not continuing:</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:48981:110"/>
indeed <hi>the judicials</hi> as to their <hi>moral equity</hi> are deemed <hi>binding,</hi> but not as they are a part of that <hi>Covenant,</hi> for then they muſt oblige exactly as they ſtand in it: theſe had a peculiar reference to the Jews.</p>
               <p>They are called judgements, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. determining of rights between man and man, and of puniſhments upon tranſgreſſions with reference to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of that people in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſaith Dr. <hi>O.</hi> on <hi>Hebrews pag.</hi> 275. and hence they cannot formally oblige others who have nothing in that Land.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Ceremonials</hi> the Apoſtle to evidence that they are aboliſhed ſpeaketh thus, Heb. 7. verſ. 11, 12. <hi>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical Prieſthood,</hi> &amp;c. where he aſſerteth perfection, <hi>(viz. as to remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin, juſtification,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 10. verſ. 16, 17, 18.) was not obtained by the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prieſthood, or legal ſacrifices and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, but only by Jeſus Chriſt who was typified therein; this he proveth thus <hi>[for under it the people received the Law]</hi> which importeth that when they arrive at evangelical perfection they are free from <hi>the Law,</hi> do not receive that, <hi>viz. as a teſtament,</hi> as <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. and he ſpeaketh <hi>of the moral Law</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from <hi>the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial:</hi> and if perfection were by that,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48981:111"/>
ſaith he, verſ. 11. <hi>what further need was there that another Prieſt ſhould ariſe after the order of</hi> Melchiſedeck, <hi>and not be called after the order of</hi> Aaron? The neceſſity of a new order of Prieſthood argueth, the imperfection of the old, and thence he inferreth the abrogation of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law. Verſ. 12. <hi>For the Prieſthood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing changed there is made of neceſſity a change of the Law:</hi> there is ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between the Prieſthood and the Law, as they ſtand and fall together; if one be aboliſhed (as the Aaronical Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prieſthood is) of neceſſity the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law (by which it ſtood) muſt be abrogated alſo, and he calleth it a carnal commandment, verſ. 16. &amp; verſ. 18. <hi>for there is verily</hi> (not only an altering and changing, but) <hi>a diſanulling of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment going before, for the weakneſs and unprofitableneſs thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame might alſo be cleared from <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. where he ſpeaketh of Ceremonial uſages, and they were till the time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, they were the patterns and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of heavenly things: <hi>the ſubſtance</hi> being come, <hi>the ſhaddow muſt vaniſh, the antitype</hi> Jeſus Chriſt being come <hi>the type muſt ceaſe:</hi> and O what a glorious privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is it, that we have freedom from
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48981:111"/>
that load of burdenſom ceremonies requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Law. There remaineth only the moral Law, that any can ſuppoſe theſe promiſes and threatnings now to be annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, and as to that,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt hath perfectly ſatisfied and fulfilled the mount</hi> Sinai <hi>Moral Law, as it was a Covenant for eternal life,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>as ſuch it is not ſtill continuing:</hi> it was impoſſible for us perfectly to obey the Law, by reaſon of the infirmity of our fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4. but whatever is demanded there,, in any of its Precepts, <hi>as the condition of life,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt hath <hi>performed</hi> it for us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. and ſo hath brought in a perfect righteouſneſs to be imputed to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. yet we are not exempted from all obedience to <hi>the Moral Law,</hi> by his obeying perfectly in our ſtead, for <hi>his righteouſneſs</hi> was for one end, <hi>viz. to merit eternal life for us, (Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 21.) <hi>our obedience</hi> is for other ends, <hi>as to teſtifie our conformity and ſubjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God and ſo to glorifie him,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> were <hi>for one end, viz.</hi> to make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for our ſin, <hi>our afflictions and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> are for <hi>other ends,</hi> and not for that.</p>
               <p>Alſo he ſatisfied all the threatnings of the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, theſe all did meet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48981:112"/>
him, Gal. 3. verſ. 13. <hi>He was made a curſe for us:</hi> ſo that theſe <hi>faederal Precepts and Curſes expire by ſatisfaction, as the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial and Ceremonial Laws did by abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There remain then only <hi>the Promiſes</hi> of it; and upon his ſatisfying the other he altereth theſe, and <hi>turneth them from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional into abſolute,</hi> as we ſee in the <hi>New Covenant.</hi> Hence, whereas in the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, that cluſter of promiſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their being <hi>a peculiar treaſure, a Kingdom of Prieſts, a holy Nation,</hi> &amp;c. Exod. 19. verſ. 5, 6. did run upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of obedience, <hi>[If ye will obey—]</hi> Jeſus Chriſt having done and ſuffered all which that Covenant could exact, now he hath given all forth in an <hi>abſolute form</hi> to believers, and expreſſeth all as already accompliſhed unto them. 1 Pet. 2. verſ. 9. <hi>But ye are a choſen generation, a Royal Prieſthood, an holy Nation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>a peculiar people,</hi> &amp;c. it is not now upon an <hi>[If]</hi> as in the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant; but the promiſe is fulfilled to them, and in Chriſt they are ſuch as it was conditionally promiſed of old they ſhould be.

thus, Exod. 20. verſ. 2. <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c. not he became their God then, but was their God before: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it be continuing to any as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it muſt be to the people of God (for it was made with none elſe) and they muſt (if any) be under the terror of it.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is evident, that Chriſtians are to yield obedience upon more evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical accounts; the Goſpel urgeth upon them, duties of holineſs, the avoiding apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie and profaneſs by ſweetneſs and love; not by legal terror, but by their freedom from it: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, <hi>to the end.</hi> As if he had ſaid, ye are not come <hi>to a legal Mount</hi> Sinai <hi>diſpenſation</hi> inforcing duty by terror, thundrings and lightnings; but <hi>to Mount</hi> Sion, to a diſpenſation of Goſpel Grace, verſ. 25. <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh,</hi> &amp;c. now the terror is upon abuſing grace.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. Their being delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Law in its compelling and condemning power, is made the means to raiſe up unto new and ſpiritual obedience. Not ſo much from <hi>the wrath as the mercy of God,</hi> Rom. 12. verſ. 1. from the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of love,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. verſ. 14. from an eying <hi>the promiſes</hi> of God, 2 Cor. 7

verſ. 1. <hi>Having theſe promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all pollution of fleſh and ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I may hint one conſiderable <hi>difference</hi> between <hi>the Covenant of Works, and that Covenant at Mount</hi> Sinai; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer extended to all mankind, and was made <hi>with all in</hi> Adam their common head: but the later was made <hi>only with ſome,</hi> with <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> the people of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>If the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant were ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing, then the people of God within it, might ſtill be laying claim to the bleſſings of it, by vertue of the ſame promiſes in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry form as they are found therein;</hi> for, if the form be altered, then the claim is by another Covenant whereby ſuch an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made.</p>
               <p>Whereas temporal mercies are promiſed in a new dialect, more abſoluely, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. <hi>verſ.</hi> 36. to the end, and 31. <hi>verſ.</hi> 27, 28, 31, 32. they are not afforded unto Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans now upon the ſame conditional terms, that they were to <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant. By way of Analogy, thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient promiſes may intimate to Chriſtians now, that walking circumſpectly is the way to be ſupplied with earthly bleſſings that are good for them: but there is <hi>no

We are apt to build <hi>expectations</hi> of mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our own doing, in ſtead of building them upon Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Evangelical obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> may be a <hi>ſecondary evidence,</hi> but when we dwell more upon any thing done by us, yea or upon <hi>any inherent grace,</hi> any thing within our ſelves, than upon <hi>the free grace of God in Chriſt,</hi> we then make ſomething of our own <hi>a ground</hi> of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and <hi>not an evidence only;</hi> when ſomething within raiſeth our hope of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, more than the grace of God in the New Covenant. <hi>The promiſe and Oath of God</hi> (which are both without us) <hi>are the two immutable things of Divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> for the raiſing <hi>ſtrong conſolation,</hi> Heb. 6. verſ. 18.

               <p>The more good there was in this, the greater excellency will appear in the new, which is a better Covenant.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>To be a provocation unto</hi> Iſrael <hi>to look unto a Mediator, the Lord Jeſus, to fulfil

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Differences between the Old and the New Covenant, and the excellency of the latter above the former.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT may be inquired, <hi>How is the New Covenant (wherein the miniſtration of Jeſus Chriſt doth lie) a better Covenant than the Old, which was made at Mount</hi> Sinai?</p>
               <p>I would premiſe, that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. and alſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. ver. 31, 32. the oppoſition is <hi>not between the Covenant of Works</hi> as with the firſt <hi>Adam and the New, but between the Old</hi> (made when <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> at <hi>Sinai) and the New Covenant:</hi> Theſe are they which are compared, and therefore the <hi>Differences</hi> between theſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their matter or form, muſt hold forth <hi>the excellency and betterneſs of the New Covenant above the Old.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The New Covenant preſuppoſeth obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto life to be performed already by Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo is better than the Old, which required an after performance of it:</hi> The very tenour of the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48981:120"/>
was <hi>[Do this and Live]</hi> Levit. 18. 5. Deut. 27. 26. Rom. 10. 5. Here <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ingaged in a federal way to perform the righteouſneſs required in the unſpotted Law; the <hi>very doing</hi> is injoyned which our Eternal Life hath dependance upon, even <hi>perfect doing,</hi> Gal. 3. 12. Indeed <hi>Iſrael in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,</hi> yet they were <hi>to perform</hi> this by their <hi>Surety Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all was then undone, unfulfilled, unperformed, Jeſus Chriſt not being then manifeſted, and hence the Law had then a commanding force, might exact that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience at the hand of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there that it ſhould be yielded in time to come.</p>
               <p>But <hi>the New Covenant</hi> taketh it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>all this doing for Life is over, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſt,</hi> and not to come, Jeſus Chriſt being actually exhibited; that as <hi>the Old Covenant</hi> ſeemed to be made up of <hi>Precepts or Commandments,</hi> ſo the New is made up of <hi>Promiſes,</hi> conſiſteth of nothing elſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. ver. 8, to the end, giving a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that all is fulfilled, there remaineth nothing to be done, either by Principal or Surety for that end, <hi>viz.</hi> Life: The Lord is ſo fully ſatisfied, as in the <hi>New</hi> he giveth a general acquittance and acknowledgeth that he hath no more to demand, all is
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48981:120"/>
turned into Promiſe <hi>[I will and ye ſhall].</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>the Mediatour of the New Teſtament,</hi> ver. 6. that is, <hi>actually</hi> ſo; to intimate that in this ſhort term <hi>[Mediatour]</hi> we have now in accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſumm of all the <hi>doing</hi> required in <hi>the Old Covenant,</hi> and way is made for our receiving the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> Heb. 9. 15. Within the ſeventy weeks the Meſſiah came, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>To make reconciliation and [bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs];</hi> before <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> was commanded, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Sinai</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but then it was introduced. <hi>By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10. 14. Nothing remaineth to be done for the procurement of theſe Eternal bleſſings.</p>
               <p>Hence in oppoſition to that <hi>Sinai Law</hi> which ran upon thoſe terms <hi>[Do and Live]</hi> under the diſpenſation of <hi>the New,</hi> we hear ſo often of <hi>[Believe and be ſaved, and he which believeth hath everlaſting Life]</hi> Mark 16. 16. Joh. 3. 16, 36. Not that <hi>[believing]</hi> now, taketh the place of <hi>[doing]</hi> in the <hi>Old Covenant;</hi> For, then it muſt be <hi>our righteouſneſs</hi> unto Juſtification, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. whereas that which juſtifieth is called, <hi>the righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> ver. 6. and Phil. 3. 9. and therefore <hi>Faith</hi> is diſtinct from <hi>that righteouſneſs it ſelf,</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:48981:121"/>
is not the leaſt Atome of it: therefore not our believing, but <hi>the obedience of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is that which cometh in the room and ſtead of that <hi>doing for Life</hi> intended in the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>He is the Lord our righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 23. 6. 1 Cor. 1. 30. But to note, that it lieth wholly out of our ſelves, that it is not by any of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, but in another, even Jeſus Chriſt, it is ſaid to be <hi>by Faith,</hi> i. e. <hi>as a means of application.</hi> Believe that the work is not now to do, Jeſus Chriſt hath done all, and ſaith he, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 24. <hi>If ye believe not that I am he, ye ſhall die in your Sins.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle, ſpeaking not meerly of the falſe opinion of the Jewes concerning the meritoriouſneſs of their good works, or their external ſervices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfect obedience to the Law unto Life; I ſay, he not inſiſting upon theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, but having mentioned <hi>the very righteouſneſs of the Law,</hi> Rom. 10. 5. in oppoſition to that, he ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 9, 10. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus and [ſhalt believe] in thy heart, that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be Saved.</hi> It is then a believing in him <hi>as already come,</hi> and having all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſubjected in him, yea as dead and riſen, that is called for. When they were
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48981:121"/>
doting upon works of the Law as perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by themſelves, to take them off from this, he telleth them that all this legal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Life muſt be found in Chriſt alone: and as it followeth <hi>[for with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs]</hi> that is, <hi>as a means unto righteouſneſs.</hi> It is not his own working that will be his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor his ſaith it ſelf, only that is a means for <hi>the applying that righteouſneſs</hi> which is <hi>ſubjected in Chriſt</hi> alone.</p>
               <p>So that the Apoſtles aim is not, to call them off from <hi>a legal doing by natural power and ability,</hi> and inſtead thereof to put them upon <hi>Evangelical believing and doing as the condition, giving right to Life;</hi> but his deſign is, to put them upon <hi>looking wholly out of themſelves</hi> and all their own doing, whether by <hi>nature or grace, unto Jeſus Chriſt alone for righteouſneſs unto Life.</hi> If a man ſhould ſet about any Goſpel ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, upon a legal ground, he would be culpable as the Judaizing Profeſſou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is ſuch a doing <hi>as giveth a little unto Life</hi> (by performing <hi>the condition</hi> of it) that is rejected in the Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians</hi> as dangerous. Evangelical ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices are required on other accounts, and to be performed to teſtifie conformity to the Will of God, and theſe may evidence

Life in the way to it; but Faith it ſelf (though neceſſary, yet) doth <hi>receive a title</hi> from Jeſus Chriſt, doth <hi>not give one,</hi> Joh. 1. 12. That Axiom <hi>[he that believeth ſhall be Saved]</hi> is not expreſſive of the <hi>tenour of the New Covenant;</hi> we claim Salvation not in the right of any act of ours, not upon the Rent of Faith (as men hold Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements by the payment of a Penny, a Roſe or ſuch like) no ſuch thing here; all is paid to the utmoſt Farthing by our Surety, and we hold and claim, upon the obedience of Jeſus Chriſt alone, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19, 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The New Covenant repreſenteth the Lord as dealing with his people univerſally in a way of Promiſe, and ſo is better than the Old, which repreſenteth him, as treating them in a way of threatning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The New conſiſteth all of <hi>Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 8. ver. 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if the heart of God were ſo full of Love, and running over therewith, that he could expreſs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but what he would be to, and do for his people. The Father having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived full ſatisfaction to all demands in the Old Covenant, by the mediation of his Son; now he maketh it his buſineſs to give the fulleſt aſſurance by a conſtellation of Promiſes in the New, that he will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48981:122"/>
to a tittle, whatſoever on his part reſteth for performance. Believers are wholly freed from the Curſe, <hi>there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. Heb. 12. 18. <hi>They are under a miniſtration of righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. ver. 9.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>the Old Covenant</hi> repreſented <hi>God as a conſuming fire, denouncing Curſes and threatnings</hi> againſt the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who were his own people (for with them was the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant made, and not with unbelievers of the Gentiles:) there were indeed ſome Promiſes ſparingly ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered up and down in it, but they run <hi>conditionally</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> failed of coming up to the condition, that if they had not been priviledged with the Covenant with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> to run unto for relief, what might they think would become of them? By Divine appointment there were ſome to ſtand upon <hi>mount</hi> Ebal <hi>to Curſe,</hi> as well as others upon <hi>mount</hi> Gerazim <hi>to bleſs,</hi> Deut. 27. 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are about <hi>twelve curſes,</hi> which they were injoyned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their aſſent unto <hi>[all the people ſhall ſay</hi> Amen] yea the laſt was <hi>a general</hi> one, ver. 26. <hi>If they continued not in all things they were liable to it,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. which ſheweth that although <hi>a temporal Curſe</hi> was not excluded, yet <hi>an Eternal</hi> was alſo ſome
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48981:123"/>
way <hi>intended,</hi> on which account it is called <hi>a miniſtration of condemnation,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 7.</p>
               <p>It was otherwiſe with them in reference to that <hi>Curſe,</hi> than it is with Chriſtians under the <hi>New. Iſrael</hi> by that <hi>voluntary act, the Old Covenant,</hi> paſſed Sentence upon themſelves: yea, <hi>the Curſe of the Law</hi> was not then actually undergone by Jeſus Chriſt, it was not then ſatisfied, and ſo might be preſented before them as their obligation or bond uncancelled to their great affrightment. But Jeſus Chriſt <hi>hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. Now all is diſcharged for us, and ſo the New is a better Covenant.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The New Covenant conſiſteth of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Promiſes, and therefore is better than the Old</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant, which did run upon conditional Promiſes, yea had works as its condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the times of the Old Teſtament, the price of our Redemption was not paid by Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore Life was then held forth upon the condition of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, the Lord ſaid <hi>[Do and Live]</hi> Lev. 18. 5. Rom 10. 5. Gal. 3. 12. Yea, as that which under <hi>the New,</hi> ſeemeth to be <hi>conditionally</hi> mentioned in one place, is <hi>abſolutely promiſed</hi> in another; ſo on the contrary, what ſeemeth to ſome, to be
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48981:123"/>
                  <hi>abſolutely propounded in the Old,</hi> in one part of it, yet is <hi>conditionally promiſed</hi> in another, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 45, 46. <hi>I will dwell among the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and be their God.</hi> Indeed this is not properly <hi>abſolute,</hi> but (as the foregoing Verſes ſhew) upon what <hi>Aaron</hi> (a Type of Jeſus Chriſt) ſhould do; however the very ſame is clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with <hi>a condition,</hi> Levit. 26. 3, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>The promiſe of <hi>circumciſing their heart and the heart of their Seed to love the Lord,</hi> Deut. 30. 6. runneth upon <hi>condition [If] thou ſhalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God and keep his Commandments,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 9.</p>
               <p>But <hi>the New Covenant</hi> conſiſteth alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>of abſolute Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 8. ver. 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>[I will—and ye ſhall].</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>the condition</hi> of any Covenant is performed, it becometh as <hi>abſolute,</hi> as if there had never been any annexed to it.</p>
               <p>Now Jeſus Chriſt is mentioned as our <hi>great High-Prieſt and Mediatour,</hi> and that as having finiſhed the work of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> ver. 1, 2, 6. and <hi>the condition</hi> contained in the Old, being exactly and compleatly fulfilled by him, it naturally or neceſſarily muſt turn into <hi>an abſolute form</hi> as in the <hi>New,</hi> becauſe upon his performance, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48981:124"/>
more is to be demanded of him, but all muſt certainly be accompliſhed unto us.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle in the Text, is purpoſely putting a difference between theſe; and ſeeing the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> was <hi>unqueſtionably conditional,</hi> and <hi>the New</hi> here in oppoſition to it or diſtinction from it, is as <hi>undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly abſolute,</hi> muſt it not needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that herein ſtandeth much of the excellency of the New above the Old?</p>
               <p>It was Propheſied of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. ver. 27. <hi>He ſhall confirm the Covenant with many for one week.</hi> A great end of his coming and death was, <hi>the confirmation of the New Covenant,</hi> on the behalf of the many which he ſtood for, ſo as now it is turned into <hi>a Teſtament,</hi> as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (which generally it is expreſſed by) doth evidence, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Though it be but a mans Teſtament, yet if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, no man diſanulleth or addeth thereto.</hi> The Free Promiſe was confirmed <hi>by Oath</hi> before, and by way of <hi>Teſtimony</hi> ſince, but eſpecially confirmed by the death of Jeſus Chriſt, by his performing <hi>the condition</hi> of it, and therefore it can admit of no addition or alteration, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16, 17. <hi>For where a Teſtament is, there muſt alſo of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be, the death of the teſtator, for a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48981:124"/>
Teſtament is of force after men are dead,</hi> &amp;c. It beareth the name of <hi>a Teſtament</hi> as in relation to his death, ſo in ſuch a proper ſenſe as it hath the Laws of <hi>a Teſtament</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it, on which account he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>[a neceſſity]</hi> of the <hi>teſtators death,</hi> and its being in force thereupon. Indeed a man may put ſome conditions into his laſt Will; I do not argue thus, it is <hi>a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament</hi> and therefore <hi>abſolute,</hi> but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>unalterable,</hi> and ſo being delivered in an <hi>abſolute form [I will, and ye ſhall]</hi> hence it muſt abide in it even in its accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment: and whereas ſome argue for conditions <hi>from the nature of a Covenant,</hi> againſt that it is aſſerted to be <hi>a laſt Will or Teſtament,</hi> which may bequeath Legacies without any condition.</p>
               <p>There is <hi>a vaſt difference</hi> between the way of Jeſus Chriſt his acting in the Work of <hi>his mediation</hi> before and ſince his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and the latter is much more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than the former. Before, he might plead, Father, thou haſt promiſed me upon my obedience hereafter to be performed, that thoſe Souls which I have undertaken for, ſhould enjoy ſuch bleſſings; there was a mutual truſt between them, and ſo he might plead it in point <hi>of faithfulneſs:</hi> but now he hath actually performed <hi>the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48981:125"/>
condition</hi> of the Covenant, and may plead it in point <hi>of Juſtice.</hi> Chriſt being actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exhibited as a propitiation, upon that, God is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26. to declare at this time his <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the time of the Old Teſtament, he ſaith, <hi>[at this time]</hi> that is, at the time of <hi>the New Teſtament,</hi> wherein the Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is truly ſhed, now God declareth <hi>his righteouſneſs</hi> in the <hi>juſtifying</hi> him that believeth in Jeſus: it is an act <hi>of Grace</hi> to thoſe who attain the remiſſion of Sin, but an <hi>act of righteouſneſs</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt: he may plead, Father, I have made ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the full, for the ſin of theſe Souls, now declare <hi>thy righteouſneſs</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of them: it is that which I have purchaſed for them, <hi>I have finiſhed the Work which thou gaveſt me to do</hi> (Joh. 17. 4.) I have paid the full price of their Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now let them have what I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for them: thus he appeareth in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in our nature, not as a meer <hi>Interceſſor</hi> but as <hi>an Advocate,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1. to plead that <hi>in Law,</hi> in right we are to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged; and this putteth a great excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency upon the New Covenant, that it is in it ſelf, and to Jeſus Chriſt thus <hi>abſolute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And note, if ſome priviledges of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant were diſpenced out properly <hi>in a
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48981:125"/>
conditional way,</hi> (as ſuppoſe Juſtification were afforded upon Faith as a condition, or temporal mercies upon obedience) yet this would be far from proving any thing to be the condition of the Promiſe, or of the Covenant it ſelf. Indeed even <hi>Faith</hi> is a particular bleſſing of it, and therefore cannot be <hi>the condition</hi> of the <hi>whole Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> for what ſhall be <hi>the condition</hi> of Faith? And there is no ſuch ſpecial Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant now extant, as the Old was, for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral mercies; they are indefinitely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and Soveraign Grace is the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining rule of diſpencing out theſe to the Saints when they are wanted, for time and meaſure as it is moſt for the glory of God and their good, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 32, 33. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing performed by us then is <hi>conditio foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deris,</hi> the <hi>condition of the Covenant it ſelf,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt hath performed all required that way.</p>
               <p>But whether any thing be <hi>conditio foedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum</hi> cometh now to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Is the New Covenant abſolute to us or conditional? Are there not conditional promiſes therein to us, as there were in the Old unto</hi> Iſrael? <hi>Can we expect any mercy but upon our performing ſome condition that it is promiſed to?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>If condition be taken improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48981:126"/>
for that which is only a connex action, or,</hi> medium fruitionis, <hi>a neceſſary duty, way or means in order to the injoyment of promiſed mercies;</hi> in this ſenſe I acknowledge there are ſome promiſes belonging to the <hi>New Covenant which are conditional,</hi> and thus are many Scriptures to be taken which are urged this way. That this might not be a meer ſtrife of words, I could wiſh men would ſtate the Queſtion thus, <hi>Whether ſome Evangelical duties be required of, and graces wrought by Jeſus Chriſt in, all the perſons that are actually intereſted in the New Covenant?</hi> I ſhould Anſwer yea; For, in the very Covenant it ſelf, it is promiſed that <hi>he will write his Laws in their hearts,</hi> Heb. 8. 10. and that implyeth <hi>Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and every gracious frame;</hi> and thoſe that have the Lord <hi>for their God are his people.</hi> If the accuſation be, that there is a want of intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, they need not plead that they have fulfilled <hi>the condition of the Covenant,</hi> but that <hi>the Covenant it ſelf</hi> in ſome promiſe of it (which uſes to be diſtinct from its condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) hath its accompliſhment upon them therein.</p>
               <p>And thoſe that are altogether without thoſe precious Graces, are ſtrangers to the Covenant, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. they cannot
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48981:126"/>
lay claim to the bleſſings of it. It is our duty earneſtly to be ſeeking after what is promiſed, and one bleſſing may be ſought as a means to another; as, the Spirit as a means to Faith, and Faith as a means to obedience, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. Believing is a great Duty in connexion with and a means of Salvation, he that believeth ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5, 9. There is <hi>an order</hi> in giving ſorth theſe bleſſings to us, and that by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine appointment, ſo as the neglecting to ſeek them therein, is highly diſpleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. This is our priviledge that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine promiſes are ſo conjoyned and twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, for the incouragement of Souls in ſeeking after them; that if one be taken, many more go along with it; like many links in a Chain that are cloſed into each other.

               <p>Anſw. 2. <hi>There is no ſuch condition of the New Covenant to us, as there was in the Old to</hi> Iſrael: for the Apoſtle is comparing them together, and in oppoſition to the Old he giveth the New altogether <hi>in abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute promiſes</hi> and that to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Heb. 8. and ſhewing that the New is not according to the Old, he diſcovereth wherein the difference lay, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Becauſe they continued not in my Covenant, and I regarded them not, ſaith the Lord,</hi> and <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 32. <hi>which Covenant they brake,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This argueth that <hi>the condition of the Old</hi> was ſuch as the performance of it did give them <hi>aſſurance</hi> of the temporal mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies promiſed and a right to them, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48981:128"/>
ſuch as failed in, left them <hi>at uncertainties</hi> whether they ſhould injoy them or not, ſo as it was not only in it ſelf and its own nature uncertain, but even as to the event, <hi>I regarded them not, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If their performing the condition had been as abſolutely promiſed, as the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the New Covenant are, then <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> would have continued in it (which they did not) and could not have forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what was promiſed thereupon, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe times they did and were excluded out of <hi>Canaan</hi> upon that account. Juriſts ſay <hi>[a condition] is, a rate, manner or Law annexed to mens acts, ſtaying or ſuſpending the ſame and making them uncertain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhall take effect or no.</hi> Cowell <hi>out of Weſt.</hi> part 1. Symb. 2. ſect. 156. And thus <hi>condition is oppoſed to abſolute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there is <hi>no ſuch condition in the New Covenant to be performed by us: giving right and title to the bleſſings of it, and leaving at uncertainties and liability to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them, as there was in the Old to be fulfilled by</hi> Iſrael, may appear,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If there be any, it muſt either be <hi>an antecedent or a ſubſequent condition; but neither:</hi> L. <hi>Coke</hi> upon <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaith of one precedent, <hi>Conditio adimpleri debet priuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ſequatur effectus. There can be no
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48981:128"/>
ſuch antecedent condition by the performance of which we get and gain entrance or admittance into Covenant,</hi> for till we be in it, no act put forth by us, can find any acceptation with God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> And our being <hi>in Covenant is in order of nature</hi> (though not of time) <hi>before Faith,</hi> becauſe it is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge or benefit of the Covenant, a part of the New heart, a fruit of the Spirit, and ſo the Spirit (which is the worker of it and another bleſſing of the Covenant) is given firſt in order before it. Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>the firſt ſaving gift,</hi> Rom. 8. 32. and with him he <hi>freely giveth all things.</hi> Men ought to be in the uſe of means, but it is the act of God that giveth admiſſion into the Covenant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. <hi>I entred into Covenant with thee, ſaith the Lord God, and thou becameſt mine.</hi> Immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were polluted in their blood, <hi>Ver.</hi> 6.

               <p>Neither is there any <hi>ſubſequent condition</hi> to be fulfilled by us; the uſe of that is, for the continuation of a right, and upon failing thereof all is forfeited, as in the caſe of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas there is no act of ours whereby
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48981:129"/>
our right unto Covenant bleſſings is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to us, upon failing whereof they may be forfeited. Our right and the ground of our claim is upon a higher ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count than any act of our own; it is even the purchaſe of Jeſus Chriſt; and they are <hi>the ſure mercies of David,</hi> Iſa. 55. 3. <hi>Sure to all the Seed,</hi> Rom. 4. 16. And when they are become <hi>believers,</hi> Eternal Life is <hi>abſolutely promiſed,</hi> Joh. 3. 16, 36. 1 Joh. 5. 10, 11, 12. and it is a contradiction to ſay, that it is abſolutely, and yet but conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally promiſed to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lord hath given aſſurance that there ſhall never be an utter violation of the New Covenant,</hi> and therefore <hi>it hath no ſuch condition as was annexed to the Old;</hi> For, the Lord declareth that <hi>they had broken his Covenant,</hi> Jer. 11. ver. 3, 4, 10. Jer. 31. ver. 32. <hi>Littleton</hi> ſpeaking of an Eſtate <hi>upon condition</hi> in deed by Feoffment, ſaith, it is called Eſtate <hi>upon condition,</hi> for that <hi>the Eſtate of the Feoffee is defeaſible if the condition be not performed.</hi> Ten. lib. 3. Cap. 4.</p>
               <p>But <hi>the New Covenant</hi> is ſecured from ſuch a violation, it cannot be diſanulled ſo as the perſons intereſted in it ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the great bleſſings promiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. <hi>I will make an everlaſting
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48981:129"/>
Covenant with them;</hi> but may there not be ſuch a condition of it as they may come ſhort of all its bleſſings? No, <hi>[I will not turn away from them to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me].</hi> If there were any danger of forfeiting and loſing theſe; it muſt be either <hi>on Gods part,</hi> by his leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, or <hi>on their part,</hi> by their departing from him; and here the Lord hath undertaken to ſecure againſt both theſe, and ſo the matter is out of Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it was not thus in the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>Indeed what the Lord hath <hi>abſolutely promiſed,</hi> yet he hath appointed <hi>means</hi> in order to the attaining of it, <hi>internal</hi> as Faith, and <hi>external</hi> as Ordinances; and commands utmoſt attendance upon him ordinarily in the uſe thereof; this is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as a duty, and ſin ariſeth upon the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of it. Thus the Lord is unalterably determined to vouchſafe a frame of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25, to 30. Yet obedience is to be performed by us, we are to be the Agents and we may ſin about the means in the way to the injoyment of ſuch mercy, as is laid up in abſolute promiſes. Faith is to be exerciſed in theſe (elſe what uſe are they of?) and we may be faulty in not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to it.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:48981:130"/>
3. If there be any ſuch <hi>condition</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> it were moſt like to <hi>be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Faith:</hi> but that is not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A condition</hi> properly taken, is <hi>influential into right;</hi> if performed <hi>it giveth right</hi> to the benefit promiſed; if not performed there is no right, and therefore is a cauſe; it giveth <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> which a man may have, and yet be forced after to Sue for poſſeſſion. If it be only in a Mode or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, it is thus; as if a great Eſtate be granted upon paying <hi>a white Lilly,</hi> if a perſon bringeth <hi>a yellow Lilly</hi> and not a white, he hath no right, all is null and void: upon ſuch a tickle point are they, who ſtand upon ſuch conditions for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mercies.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Faith</hi> giveth no right, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>To as many as received him, gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is offered in the free Promiſe of the Goſpel; <hi>Faith</hi> that conſenteth or <hi>receiveth him, and a right and title in him, to the bleſſings of the Covenant,</hi> it doth not <hi>give</hi> one.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Father offereth righteouſneſs</hi> in a way of gift, Rom. 5. 17. <hi>Faith accepteth the offer,</hi> receiveth Jeſus Chriſt for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and ſo conduceth to Juſtification <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3. Abraham <hi>believed God and it
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48981:130"/>
was counted to him for righteouſneſs,</hi> i. e. <hi>it was reckoned a means unto righteouſneſs,</hi> ſo ver. 5. Not that Faith it ſelf was reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the leaſt of that <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> whereby we are juſtified, but <hi>a means</hi> for the apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of. Jeſus Chriſt who is <hi>our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> The Covenant as to that priviledge of it, <hi>Juſtification,</hi> is not ſo abſolute as to be <hi>without all means,</hi> yet may be abſolute <hi>without any condition</hi> properly ſo called. As <hi>condemnation</hi> (without any new act of receiving) is the reſultancy from the Law upon diſobedience, to all under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works; ſo <hi>Juſtification</hi> is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultancy of a Divine Promiſe, upon the obedience of Jeſus Chriſt, to all thoſe that are under <hi>the New Covenant.</hi> That unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are not juſtified by it, is becauſe they are not actually under it. Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not fulfilled the condition of it; but becauſe they are not intereſted in <hi>the obediential righteouſneſs</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt which is <hi>the condition of it,</hi> Rom. 10. 10. The act of God in juſtifying is to be anſwered by the act of Faith, conſenting to the offer of the Goſpel. As the death and ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt is enough to anſwer, if the accuſation be that we are ſinners and deſerve Eternal wrath; ſo, if the accuſation be, that we have no intereſt
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48981:131"/>
or portion in this ſatisfaction, any thing that can evidence our intereſt in Chriſt, is a ſufficient plea to anſwer that; be it Faith or other Graces; they may be pleaded <hi>as evidences,</hi> but not <hi>as titles: as fruits and effects of a right given,</hi> but not <hi>as cauſes, and conditions</hi> fulfilled by us <hi>giving us that right.</hi> It is a great miſtake to think, that there is no plea in this caſe, but from the performance of <hi>a condition;</hi> For, an evidence may be from <hi>the effects as well as from cauſes:</hi> even in civils, a meer witneſs may carry it in ſuch a charge, when he can teſtifie, I ſaw the perſon put into peaceable poſſeſſion of ſuch an Eſtate. Beſides, if this charge he drawn up againſt thoſe out of Chriſt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things may make it good; if againſt thoſe that are in Chriſt, then who draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this up? <hi>Not God;</hi> for he it is that <hi>juſtifieth,</hi> and therefore he will <hi>not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,</hi> Rom. 8. 33, 34. if <hi>Satan or their own hearts,</hi> then as gracious effects are enough to anſwer, ſo by direct acts of Faith, there ought to be a ſtedfaſt reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and withſtanding of Satan, and he will flee from them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 7. No neceſſity of pleading the performance of <hi>a condition</hi> to help againſt this.</p>

                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:48981:131"/>
4. <hi>Our obedience though evangelical is no ſuch condition of the New Covenant, as there was of the Old unto</hi> Iſrael: For, the Lord hath undertaken that his people ſhall obey, Ezek. 36. 25, to 30. <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ways:</hi> Heb. 8. 10. obedience is <hi>as abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed</hi> as any other bleſſings in the New, and therefore it cannot be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition thereof. The Apoſtle having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted and largely proved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. that juſtification is <hi>by faith,</hi> not by <hi>the works of the Law,</hi> he further cleareth it from the inſtances <hi>of</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> David <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3. Abraham <hi>believed,</hi> &amp;c. and verſ. 4. <hi>Now to him that worketh the reward is not reckoned of grace but of debt.</hi> This ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implieth, that the reward muſt be reckoned <hi>of grace but of debt.</hi> This ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implieth, that the reward muſt be reckoned <hi>of grace and not of debt;</hi> the <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis</hi> is upon this, ſo as if it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the whole force of his argument were taken away; and the <hi>ſtreſs</hi> is not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word <hi>[reckoned]</hi> yet if it were, the ſame word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> (being applied to both) muſt ſignifie a true judgement and juſt eſtimation <hi>(as Rom.</hi> 8. 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1.) for, <hi>really and in true account the reward is of grace,</hi> and it is as firmly aſſerted that if it were of works it were (in the ſame account) <hi>of debt.</hi> Say ſome,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48981:132"/>
only <hi>meritorious works</hi> would make it ſo: but let it be conſidered, that <hi>works</hi> can be <hi>meritorious</hi> only one of theſe two ways; either,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By being of ſuch value and worth, as that in juſtice ſuch a recompence is deſerved by them, yea though there were no contract that way:</hi> and dare any ſay, that any works of men, even in innocency, could thus <hi>merit</hi> at the hands of God? is not all obedience due to God, ſo as when we have done all we are unprofitable ſervants? Luk. 17. 10. Job 22. 3. &amp; 35. 7. <hi>If thou be righteous what giveſt thou him?</hi> Rom. 11. 35. <hi>Who hath firſt given to him and it ſhall be recompenſed to him again? Credendum eſt firmiter dari nihil ab homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus per modum indebiti, vel accipi à Deo per modum lucri.</hi> Tract. Sacr. Or elſe,</p>
               <p n="2">2. They <hi>merit ex pacto, by ſome contract or Covenant:</hi> that though the works be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable in value, to the reward, yet the Lord hath promiſed ſuch a reward to them: thus only and no otherwiſe, could <hi>the obedience of</hi> Adam in a ſtate of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <hi>be meritorious,</hi> for he did owe all as duty to God, even by right of creation; he might have required all, without ingaging himſelf to give any reward; and finite ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices could not merit in worth and value
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48981:132"/>
an infinite reward; but the Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to his perfect unſinning works. No otherwiſe did any among the <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Galatians</hi> expect <hi>juſtification or eternal life in a way of works,</hi> but only falſly imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the Lord had made <hi>a promiſe of ſalvation unto theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus a reward may be <hi>of merit and of debt, and yet of grace in ſome ſenſe</hi> (though not of ſpecial Goſpel grace) for all good promiſed or given by the Lord to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is <hi>of grace,</hi> ſeeing God oweth nothing to any. Thus the making of a promiſe to <hi>Adam</hi> in a ſtate of innocency for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding of his works <hi>was of grace;</hi> yet the promiſe being made, if he had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in that ſtate, <hi>the reward</hi> would have been <hi>of debt:</hi> and therefore upon the ſame ground, if the reward were now promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to us upon evangelical obedience, then that were as truly <hi>meritorious</hi> (though the condition were more favourable) and life <hi>as really of debt,</hi> as it would have been to <hi>Adam</hi> upon his ſinleſs obedience; for, only the promiſe muſt have made it ſo there, and the ſame is found here. The Text in hand, muſt refer either <hi>to the works of the Law,</hi> which cannot properly <hi>merit,</hi> becauſe due even by <hi>the Law of Nature,</hi> or. elſe <hi>to thoſe performed by</hi> Abraham <hi>after
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48981:133"/>
believing,</hi> and then he concludes that if the reward were of theſe, it were reckoned of debt: neither of theſe could render it ſo, but only by a Divine promiſe aſſuring ſuch a reward upon the performing ſuch works as the condition thereof; and therefore ſeeing he concludeth it <hi>not of debt,</hi> hence no obedience of our own can be ſuch a condition of the New Covenant. It is difficult to underſtand how the reward can be <hi>a debt legally and in juſtice due,</hi> and yet <hi>not God a debtor,</hi> when it is only his compact or Covenant that it becometh <hi>debt;</hi> if that may be our due which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſſeſſeth though he be not bound to us, yet where it becometh due only by promiſe (as in the caſe in hand) and that upon <hi>an act of ours</hi> as the (ſuppoſed) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> it ſeemeth that <hi>the promiſer is a debtor,</hi> though conſidered antecedently to his promiſe he was free; and in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4. not only is <hi>God</hi> denied <hi>to be a debtor</hi> but the <hi>reward</hi> is denied to be a <hi>debt;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is no promiſe of it upon ſuch a condition as our works, which would make it <hi>of debt:</hi> in oppoſition to that, it is ſaid to be of <hi>grace,</hi> that is, <hi>of Goſpel Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's true there are <hi>Divine Promiſes</hi> of the reward upon Chriſts works; but they are
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48981:133"/>
not made <hi>immediately to us</hi> either upon our believing or obeying; but <hi>mediately</hi> and at the ſecond hand, ſo as the ground of our claim is not our performing any Goſpel condition upon which it is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (for then it were as really of debt as <hi>Adams)</hi> but all the Promiſes are <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately made to Jeſus Chriſt upon his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and meritorious obedience,</hi> on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all become <hi>debt</hi> to him; and thus God is not a debtor to us, but to himſelf, to his own goodneſs and faithfulneſs and to his Son, and <hi>not our works;</hi> but <hi>faith</hi> is the means unto our being counted righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in <hi>his righteouſneſs, which only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited</hi> our eternal reward, 2 Cor. 1. 20. <hi>All the promiſes [in him] are yea and [in him] Amen,</hi> &amp;c.

Saith <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83. <hi>Debitorem Dominus ipſe fecit ſe, non accipiendo ſed promittendo;</hi> we can plead for nothing promiſed but upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>of Divine faithfulneſs;</hi> whereas if

I confeſs there is difficulty here on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, for <hi>if believers be under the Laws curſe and obligation by new ſins, then they are unjuſtified as often as they ſin</hi> (which may not be admitted;) and if they be not under it, then it ſeemeth they are <hi>not daily pardoned, ſeeing pardon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in a declared diſcharge from that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation:</hi> this will be anſwered in a follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objection.</p>

               <p>That <hi>the actual remiſſion, pardon or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of their ſins who are in Covenant and already juſtified, is the very inſtant wherein the ſins are committed, ſo as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers remain not one moment under the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Law to eternal puniſhment, or the immediateneſs of pardon may appear thus:</hi>

               <p>And here let it be obſerved, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don or forgiveneſs of ſin, is <hi>a Divine grant by the Law of Grace the New Covenant,</hi> that is his <hi>act of Oblivion,</hi> Heb. 8. 12. Heb. 10. 16, 17. Rom. 11. 27. On which
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48981:142"/>
account we read of <hi>[the Law] of Works,</hi> and <hi>[the Law] of Faith,</hi> Rom. 3. 27. and this latter in reference to Juſtification and remiſſion of ſin. As, <hi>preſent condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is by a Law,</hi> even by the <hi>Divine Law of Works,</hi> that paſſeth Sentence upon ſinners; the ſeed of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> who are under it, the very <hi>inſtant of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> whether they be aware of it or not: So anſwerably, <hi>preſent Juſtification and remiſſion of ſin, is by the Law of Grace the New Covenant,</hi> that paſſeth <hi>a Sentence</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the ſeed of Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> who are under it, <hi>the very inſtant of their ſinning,</hi> when often at the very time they do not diſcern it.

                  </gap> may have his offences pardoned by an Act of Oblivion which he is under, though no accuſation be drawn up againſt him to put his caſe upon tryal before a Judge, that may come afterward: thus it is <hi>not by a judicial Act,</hi> by an Act of God <hi>as a Judge,</hi> but <hi>as a Law-giver</hi> that he giveth preſent <hi>Juſtification and Pardons,</hi> they are the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his Law the New Teſtament,</hi> which Believers are alwaies under; accuſations from Satan or their own Conſciences may come afterward, and a tryal before the Judge in the great day.</p>

The not underſtanding this, hath run into many miſtakes; ſome aſſerting Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to be from Eternity; whereas they might eaſily underſtand that the Elect may, yea muſt be under <hi>a Sentence of the Law of Works</hi> (without the leaſt execution of the Curſe upon them by the Lord as a Judge) <hi>till by coming under the Sentence of another Law, even the New Teſtament they be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others talk of <hi>pleading to a charge, and upon a plea being diſcharged as their Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> whereas that is only the Sentence <hi>of one Law,</hi> declaring a diſcharge <hi>from the Sentence or Curſe of another Law,</hi> upon their intereſt in <hi>the righteouſneſs</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt by union with him. The Lord is not dealing as a Judge there; often the Lord is mentioning <hi>Judgement</hi> as a future thing; <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoned <hi>[of Judgement to come]</hi> Act. 24. 25. Matth. 11. 22, 24. and 12. 36. 2 Pet. 2. 9. Joh. 12. 47, 48. <hi>The Word will judge you at the laſt day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The preſent work of Jeſus Chriſt, is <hi>not to judge</hi> the World, but to ſave it. Now he cometh in a diſpenſation full of Grace, with intreaties and beſeechings that he may win over Souls to a ſubjection unto the Law of Faith, which is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48981:143"/>
of <hi>righteouſneſs and Life</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly glorious, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>But he will deal in another way, when he cometh forth <hi>as a Judge,</hi> then he will come cloathed with terrour, and we muſt all appear before his judgement Seat, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. When the times of refreſhing ſhall come, then will <hi>their ſins be blotted out,</hi> Act. 3. 19. Not as if they wanted <hi>a compleat pardon</hi> till the day of Judgement. They are now as fully <hi>and perfectly juſtified and pardoned,</hi> as they <hi>were condemned.</hi> It was by <hi>a Law</hi> againſt them that they were under <hi>condemnation,</hi> and ſo it is <hi>by a Law grant,</hi> viz. <hi>the New Covenant,</hi> that they <hi>are juſtified and have the remiſſion of ſin.</hi> Some call it <hi>a ſentential Juſtification;</hi> there will be a repetition of its Sentence, ſo as they will be <hi>judicially acquitted</hi> before all the World in the great day. In <hi>what Court or by what Judge</hi> are any ſo <hi>pardoned here?</hi> If the <hi>Bar or Tribunal</hi> of this Judgement be <hi>a mans own Conſcience,</hi> that can hardly paſs Sentence without diſcerning and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf within <hi>the New Covenant,</hi> and pleading that againſt the accuſation of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; whereas a Soul may have <hi>the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and juſtifying Faith</hi> before he knoweth it, or be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it, and therefore Juſtification and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48981:143"/>
may be before any judicial act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>If Believers be not actually under the obligation to puniſhment (which is guilt) then asking the removal of it, or praying for daily pardon of ſin is unneceſſary. Yea, if they be not obliged, they cannot be diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, and ſo not pardoned; therefore it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Curſe of the Law muſt be in force againſt them for ſome ſpace before the new Pardon cometh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. I. <hi>Believers in their daily pardons are declared to be diſcharged from the very obligation and Curſe of the Law it ſelf, but not from a perſonal obligation to it.</hi> There is <hi>an obligation to puniſhment</hi> reſiding in <hi>the Law,</hi> but it doth <hi>not actually paſs upon the perſons</hi> of Believers one moment.</p>
               <p>It muſt be remembred that preſent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is <hi>not a judicial act,</hi> but it is a Sentence of <hi>a Law of Grace,</hi> which declareth all under it to be diſcharged from the <hi>penalty</hi> of another <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve, when a violated Law hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſſed Sentence upon an offender, an act of <hi>pardon</hi> coming afterward in force to him, there it <hi>diſſolveth or taketh off an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to puniſhment</hi> which is already paſſed upon the perſon, and this is the caſe of the Elect at firſt converſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:48981:144"/>
But where an Act or Law of Pardon is in force to any perſons and reacheth to offences yet to come, or not yet commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there the obligation to the penalty never paſſeth one moment upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and yet they have as much forgiven (even the whole penalty of the Law) as the other, and more Grace in it; For, it preventeth the paſſing of the Sentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
               <p>Now, this is the caſe, <hi>Believers are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies under the New Covenant,</hi> which is <hi>a Divine Act of Pardon;</hi> this Law is in force to them before their Commiſſion of new acts of ſin, and declareth their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from the penalty of the Law of Works, that the inſtant wherein the ſins are committed, they are remitted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
               <p>The commanding Law is not repealed (for then they were no offences) but yet the Curſe of it reſteth not upon their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons one moment, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 2, 3. <hi>If any one ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Pardons afforded to ſinners are from Jeſus Chriſt <hi>as an offering Prieſt, making ſatisfaction for ſin;</hi> but if one of thoſe who have fellowſhip with God, if Believers
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48981:144"/>
ſin, their ſuccour and relief is alſo by <hi>the ſtanding Advocateſhip</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt. Now, <hi>an Advocate, or Atturney</hi> pleadeth <hi>a Law in force,</hi> whereby his Client is diſcharged; ſo Jeſus Chriſt pleadeth, Believers being already under the New Teſtament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have a right unto indempnity; that though the Curſing Law remaineth in force ſtill to unbelievers, yet this new Act of Grace granteth a pardon to the Saints for all tranſgreſſions committed againſt it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is yet unqueſtionably the duty of Believers to be daily praying for pardoning mercy:</hi> Thoſe who are taught to cry unto God <hi>[Our Father]</hi> Luk. 11. 2. yet are to ſay, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Forgive us our ſins.</hi> Thoſe then which have the Spirit of Adoption, yet are to be praying daily for <hi>the pardon of Sin.</hi> There is <hi>reatus ſimplex</hi> as well as <hi>reatus redundans in perſonam;</hi> though Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are not to confeſs themſelves to be perſonally <hi>(i. e.</hi> in their perſons,) to be under the obligation or Curſe of the Law (there is cauſe for higheſt thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of Grace in their freedom from that) yet there is room for the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt acknowledgement of their own ſin and guiltineſs <hi>in deſerving</hi> of it, and here is enough for their <hi>humiliation:</hi> though the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48981:145"/>
perſon by Grace is <hi>acquitted or pardoned,</hi> yet there is <hi>a dueneſs</hi> of ſuch a penalty to ſuch an offence according to the Divine Law: and this may be owned even under the cleareſt evidences of pardon; for that doth not remove the deſert of ſin, but freeth from what is deſerved thereby.</p>
               <p>Yea, there is a great deal of work for Faith in Prayer, upon this account.</p>
               <p>Believers are to pray for the continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Pardon, which they do already injoy, and for the remiſſion of thoſe ſins which ſhall hereafter be committed by them. The <hi>New Covenant</hi> containeth in it a Promiſe of <hi>future pardons,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith may act upon the Lord in it, and that although they know they ſhall be forgiven. The Promiſe-aſſurance of a mercy doth not exempt us from praying for it. Jeſus Chriſt had aſſurance that he ſhould be glorified and yet he prayeth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 5. <hi>Father glorifie thou me:</hi> he knew that he ſhould be kept and yet he prayeth for it, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>David</hi> had an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Promiſe of eſtabliſhing his Houſe and Kingdom for ever, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 14, 15. 16. and yet he the rather prayeth for it; and upon that ground, even the Promiſe of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:48981:145"/>
So we may ask future Pardons, though we certainly know we ſhall have them.</p>
               <p>Alſo we are to ask clearer manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our intereſt in pardoning mercy.</p>
               <p>But further, Believers in praying for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin, are</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To ask a freſh application of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt in the promiſe of pardon:</hi> he is ſaid to be to that very end <hi>a propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> through Faith in his blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. not only is <hi>a manifeſtation of pardon</hi> to be ſought after, but <hi>Faith</hi> is to be exerciſed in <hi>an application of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as that which hath purchaſed and procured <hi>the pardon;</hi> that is to be eyed as the price of Redemption, as that which ratifieth the New Teſtament <hi>for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Mat. 26. 28. it is <hi>that blood which cleanſeth</hi> thoſe that have fellowſhip with God <hi>from all Sin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 3, 7, 9. <hi>He is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt be by a Word or Promiſe that the faithfulneſs of God is ingaged this way, and it is the work of Faith to own that, and the Grace of God that ſhineth forth therein, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 43. <hi>whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him ſhall receive the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> The Lords <hi>giving</hi> it is in order of nature firſt, but to be followed with mens <hi>receiving</hi> it through Faith. Gods act of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48981:146"/>
pardon diſobliging Believers, the inſtant of their ſinning, is to be anſwered with <hi>a renewed act of Faith applying this to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> ſetting their Seal to what God hath done, yea <hi>renewed acts of Repentance</hi> alſo are to follow. Under the Old Covenant <hi>it was not poſſible, that the blood of Bulls and Goats ſhould take away ſins,</hi> Heb. 10. 4. but <hi>the New Teſtament is better,</hi> for therein through the bleſſed <hi>Mediatour</hi> believers obtain <hi>real remiſſion,</hi> Heb. 9. 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>To ask impunity, or immunity and freedom from the execution of the Curſe, and from other tokens of Divine diſpleaſure:</hi> if they know they ſhall have it, yet they are to ask it, as I before evidenced. Though Believers know that God is a Father, and that the <hi>Eternal Curſe</hi> will <hi>never ſeize</hi> upon them, yet they are <hi>to pray</hi> for a freedom from it, and the rather be incouraged and provoked to it, becauſe the Lord hath promiſed it.</p>
               <p>Although by the New Covenant Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is continued, yet by groſs acts of ſin the Lord may be provoked ſo as many ſweet effects of their being juſtified may be ſuſpended. <hi>David</hi> who was in a ſtate of Grace, when he had notoriouſly ſinned, before renewed <hi>acts of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> before <hi>confeſſing his ſin, his bones
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48981:146"/>
waxed old through his roaring all the day long,</hi> Pſal. 32. 3, 4. <hi>Day and Night the band of God was heavy upon him.</hi> By this it is evident, that although, at the inſtant of ſinning, Believers are declared <hi>really</hi> diſobliged from the Eternal Curſe of the Law, yet they may not be <hi>ſenſibly</hi> freed from that, nor from temporal evils till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. They are exempted from <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive Juſtice,</hi> in order to the making <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for ſin, but not from <hi>paternal corrective diſpenſations</hi> to the humbling for and deterring from ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 2, 7. <hi>Waſh me throughly from my ſin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Purge me with Hyſſop,</hi> &amp;c. He was deeply ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his pollution, defilement and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs by reaſon of iniquity, maketh confeſſion, and ſeeketh the removal of it, <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. <hi>That he might juſtifie God,</hi> whom he had greatly diſhonoured, and give glory to him by acknowledging his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all his judgements; he cryeth out, <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Hide thy face from my ſins,</hi> they were not only ever before him, but ſeemed to be ſo before the Lord alſo; as if he were alwaies looking on them: though he had not loſt <hi>his Salvation,</hi> yet he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much of <hi>the joy of it,</hi> ver. 11, 12. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> told him God had <hi>pardoned him his ſin,</hi> (2 Sam. 12. 13, 14.) only ſome tokens
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48981:147"/>
of Divine diſpleaſure muſt be expected; and I think he Penned this Penitentlal <hi>Pſalm</hi> after, for the title ſheweth that this confeſſion was directed to the chief Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician; it was for the uſe of the <hi>Temple;</hi> he had confeſſed privately before to <hi>Nathan,</hi> now he doth it more publickly, after he had told him of pardon and alſo of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>So that after Souls are <hi>really diſobliged and have pardon it ſelf,</hi> yet they may want the ſenſe of it, till there be a freſh applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, by the Spirit to them, ſo as they may cry out for it, as he, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Blot out all my iniquities.</hi> There may be inward cloudings and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſin and guilt may lie heavy upon the Conſcience, there may be throbbing there, and a dreadful ſenſe of it, which may be enough to deterr from ſin. He will <hi>viſit tranſgreſſions with a Rod,</hi> though <hi>his loving kindneſs he will not utterly take from them,</hi> Pſal. 89. 32, 33. And who is willing to ſee the <hi>frowning face of God a tender Father,</hi> and to have ſuch ſmart rebukes not only by outward corporal afflictions, but by the withdrawing the light of his countenance, which is better than Life?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Old Covenant</hi> did not purge <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> but the New is <hi>a better Teſtament;</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:48981:147"/>
for having mentioned <hi>the remiſſion of ſins</hi> afforded thereby, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 16, 17. he addeth, <hi>let us draw near with a true heart in full aſſurance of Faith [having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience]</hi> ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. In the way of a freſh exerciſe of Faith they may have freedom not only from other <hi>fatherly corrections,</hi> but from thoſe <hi>accuſations of an evil Conſcience</hi> which are the uſual fruits of hainous ſins, till re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed acts of Faith and Repentance.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>The New Covenant raiſeth a choice Spirit of filial Love, and ſo is better than the Old, which leaveth under a Spirit of ſervile fear:</hi> the <hi>New</hi> being made up all of Promiſes, muſt needs have a tendency to raiſe into the ſweeteſt Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>For, ye have not received the Spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of Adoption whereby we cry Abba Father.</hi> There is an excellency in the <hi>Evangelical Spirit</hi> then above the other. I underſtand that Text of different ſtates of the Church, or People of God; ſeeing in the former and following Chapters, he evidently ſpeaketh of Believers freedom from the Law by the Lord Jeſus, and the particle <hi>[again]</hi> doth intimate, that once they were under that fearing Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> under the Old <hi>Moſaick</hi> diſpenſation,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48981:148"/>
but now in the times of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were freed from it. Some by the Spirit of bondage underſtand operations of the Spirit, in fear and terrour in order to converſion. I cannot find, that he is treating of that, and it is more ſuitable to underſtand it of the ſtate under the Old Teſtament, and the rather becauſe it is brought in as a proof of their Sonſhip, as the particle <hi>[for]</hi> doth intimate; it was therefore no deſirable frame to be ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but a miſery to be under it, and a mercy to be freed from it. The Old Covenant car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with it more of the <hi>[Spirit of a Servant]</hi> as the word ſignifieth, and although ſerving the Lord chiefly or only for reward ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of <hi>a legal Spirit,</hi> and is one difference between the Spirit of a Servant, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Son, yet here <hi>another difference</hi> is aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, for it is ſaid, ye have not received it <hi>[again to fear].</hi> The <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant put them on to duty <hi>by dreadful threatnings, preſented Curſes</hi> before them (and that not actually undergone for them by Jeſus Chriſt) as Arguments or inforcements thereunto, which terrifieth and filleth with ſuch <hi>fear</hi> as is found <hi>in Servants</hi> by the <hi>ſevere threatning</hi> of their <hi>Maſters; Iſrael</hi> was filled with fear and aſtoniſhment at the firſt promulgation of the Law. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whether
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48981:148"/>
this was the proper effect of the <hi>Sinai</hi> Law, to work into ſervile fear and bondage, ſo as to make that <hi>duty</hi> then, which now is not ſo, and whether it were the approved effect of it in that day or not, yet it intimateth, that through the frailty of ſinful man, this would certainly be the iſſue of it, and was even unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; hearing the Law from the mouth of an all-powerful God as a conſuming fire; and there was not enough in thoſe <hi>conditional promiſes</hi> to free from this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile fear, and ſo it left them under it; and <hi>comparatively</hi> with the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> which hath more <hi>Evangelical inforcements</hi> unto duty by Grace, and the free Promiſe. The <hi>Sinai</hi> Law hath a tendency to work into the fear of a Servant, towards his Maſter, and ſo (as the Apoſtle ſaith) gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth to bondage, rather than to the fear or love of a Son, which is the iſſue of Goſpel Revelations.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians now are to act upon more <hi>Evangelical</hi> accounts, from more Love, yea and more Faith, having received the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father; it is by this believing Spirit that Souls have liberty of acceſs to God with that freedom that Children uſe to have in going to a tender Father. The <hi>fearing
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48981:149"/>
Spirit</hi> kept them at a diſtance from the Lord like a Servant, that durſt not come near an auſtere Maſter, but by this they may with a holy boldneſs and firm aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance repair to him, <hi>and cry Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This will appear more clearly, if we compare it with that parallel place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1, 2, &amp;c. <hi>The Heir ſo long as he is a Child differeth nothing from a Servant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Even ſo we when we were Children were in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, under the Elements of the World,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here, the ſtate under the <hi>Old</hi> Sinai <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> plainly is expreſſed by <hi>bondage,</hi> not abſolutely that of <hi>bondſlaves,</hi> they were not in pure ſlavery, nor ſo in the condition of Servants; but <hi>as under Tutors and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, and in a ſtate of ſubjection,</hi> that they differed little in outward appearance to themſelves or others from <hi>Servants,</hi> they ſeemed to have more of that Spirit (being acted by fear) than of the Spirit of Sons: but ſince the diſpenſation of the New Covenant, they are freed from the <hi>ſervile ſtate,</hi> redeemed by Jeſus Chriſt, from the <hi>rigour of the Law,</hi> and have much of the Spirit of Adoption, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. there is ſuch an alteration for the better, as if their <hi>Sonſhip</hi> now began, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. that is

                  <hi>comparatively</hi> with the other; therefore Chriſtians now are to act in a different way from what they did of Old; more in a free Spirit of Adoption: thus <hi>bondage and freedom</hi> are oppoſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 24, 25, 26, 31. not as taken for <hi>ſimple ſlavery,</hi> but for a ſtate of <hi>leſs freedom,</hi> though in the ſame Family and Houſe, as <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> were, the one expreſly intending the ſtate under the mount <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, the other under the Free Promiſe, ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24. <hi>The Law was our Schoolmaſter until Chriſt,</hi> ſo it is in the Original, we have not there thoſe words <hi>[to bring us].</hi> This Text doth not ſpeak of a work of the Law ſtill continuing in order to converſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt, for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls unto him; but telleth us of the rigorous diſcipline of the Law of Old to <hi>Iſrael</hi> the people of God, like <hi>a Schoolmaſter</hi> with a Rod compelling to duty, <hi>until Chriſt,</hi> i. e. until <hi>his Incarnation,</hi> until <hi>his ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> it ſpeaketh of ſuch a uſe thereof which is now at an end in Goſpel times, as appeareth by the Antitheſis, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>but after faith is come</hi> we are <hi>no longer under a Schoolmaſter,</hi> &amp;c. that is, after Chriſt the object of Faith is come in the fleſh, and hath ſatisfied the Law, hath purchaſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for us, now we are no longer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the menaces and ſeverities of the Law <hi>as a Schoolmaſter;</hi> as Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>our hope,</hi> ſo he is <hi>our faith,</hi> that is, the object of it, the thing believed.

               <p>The Old Covenant did not it ſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe out ſpiritual and eternal bleſſings, but provoked to have recourſe unto the <hi>Abrahamatical Covenant</hi> for theſe, they muſt ſetch a greater compaſs in travelling

to thoſe injoyments than under the New; they muſt look from the Old for remiſſion of ſin (which was typified there) and ſo for ſuch other mercies, unto the free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. In the New Covenant mercies are abſolutely promiſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. and therefore the application of them is more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate than under the Old; they may forth. with by an eye of faith look to Jeſus Chriſt for a fruition-of them; there is not ſuch a vail of typical inſtitutions to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene, that is a better way to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of thoſe bleſſings, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
               <p>Yea the diſpenſation is alſo better, the Apoſtle ſaith, Heb. 1. 1, 2. <hi>That God in the laſt days hath ſpoken to us by his Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> This is the excellency of Goſpel diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries above viſions, dreams, and ſuch like afforded in old reſtament times, that now Juſus Chriſt himſelf ſpeaketh to us with his own mouth, we have more <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate manifeſtations,</hi> and on that account there is infinite danger in non-attendance to what is ſpoken. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 25.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the time of firſt coming into Covenant.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT may be asked, <hi>When is it that any are actually and perſonally intereſted in the Spiritual benefits, or bleſſings of the New and better Covenant?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not <hi>a virtual but an actual intereſt</hi> that is here inquired after; and, not when they were <hi>repreſentatively</hi> in Covenant in their <hi>common perſon,</hi> but when <hi>perſonally</hi> by an application of its bleſſings to their own perſons?</p>
               <p>And indeed the <hi>New Covenant</hi> is for <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi> and is the ſumm of all that is to be applyed, though it be not the whole Covenant of Grace, which taketh in all Articles between God the Father, and Jeſus Chriſt the Son, in order to our reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>And it is to be noted, That ſome are <hi>viſibly,</hi> others are <hi>really</hi> under the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some who are branches <hi>in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> yet may be <hi>broken off,</hi> Joh. 15. 2, 6. Rom. 11.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48981:153"/>
and therefore were but <hi>viſibly</hi> in him. Some are <hi>ſanctified with the blood of the Covenant,</hi> and yet afterward may <hi>count it an unholy thing,</hi> Heb. 10. 23. and ſo are but <hi>viſibly</hi> under it, by an <hi>outward ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to, or profeſſion of</hi> the name and Faith <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to as to partake of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon priviledges belonging to its <hi>external diſpenſation:</hi> perſons thus <hi>in Covenant</hi> and under <hi>the ſign</hi> of it, may be in <hi>a periſhing condition ſtill,</hi> Act. 8. 13, 23. <hi>Outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> of Faith is not that which <hi>entituleth</hi> to the external adminiſtrations of it, but only is a <hi>character or mark</hi> of perſons fit for them, as ſhewing a viſible intereſt in the Promiſe by a poſſeſſion <hi>[of the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed];</hi> and <hi>their Seed</hi> have as ſure <hi>a mark</hi> of their being <hi>viſibly</hi> under <hi>[the Promiſe],</hi> by the Lords declaring them intereſted therein with their Parents, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 9. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. and this not by the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> (as ſome would have it) which is diſanulled, but by that with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is yet in force, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
               <p>And beſides, the ſame that are <hi>the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of the New Covenant, were <hi>the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of the Old, even <hi>the houſe of Iſrael and Judah,</hi> Jer. 31. 31, 32. Heb. 8.</p>
               <p>As <hi>the Faith of</hi> Abraham was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the Promiſe (which was made
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48981:154"/>
to him) for <hi>his Seed;</hi> ſo many other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Faith be acting for theirs. It's true all of them may not be ſaved, the ſame is to be ſaid of adult Profeſſours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Promiſe unto either (as to rea intereſt) is to be underſtood <hi>indefinitely not univerſally;</hi> even as promiſes attending Family inſtruction, yea and the publick Preaching of the Word: Chriſt is with his <hi>Miniſters</hi> to the end of the World, though all that <hi>hear</hi> be not converted; they are the means uſually bleſſed to ſuch ends.</p>
               <p>But there is <hi>a real intereſt</hi> in the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> ſuch as is certainly attended with <hi>Salvation,</hi> when the <hi>ſpecial bleſſings</hi> of it be theirs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. this is it that I would chiefly inquire after here, when it is afforded?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Real actual and perſonal intereſt in the New and better Covenant, is afforded unto Souls when they attain unto union with Jeſus Chriſt, and the gift of Faith, not one moment of time before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Abſtractedly from Chriſt or till in him, not one Promiſe is thine; For, <hi>all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God [in him] are yea, and [in him]</hi> Amen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 6. all made, treaſured up, and fulfilled or accompliſhed in him; if Chriſtleſs, then Promiſeleſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48981:154"/>
Jeſus Chriſt is the firſt ſaving gift of God; Chriſt and the Promiſes go together.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>ſpecial marks of diſtinction</hi> whereby perſons in Covenant <hi>are differenced from the World,</hi> which agree to none that are <hi>out of Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 9. 15. they are <hi>called ones</hi> that <hi>receive the Promiſe. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> that famous <hi>Covenanter</hi> was <hi>not actually</hi> ſo, till the time of his <hi>effectual calling;</hi> from thence the four hundred and thirty years do commence, which give the firſt date to the Covenant or Promiſe, as made with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. not from the day of his Nativity, much leſs from Eternity, although then he was an Elect Veſſel: by becoming Chriſts, men become <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed and Heirs of Promiſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. 14, 26, 29.</p>
               <p>So the <hi>New Covenant</hi> runneth to the <hi>Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and</hi> Judah, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8 13. and none are the <hi>ſpiritual Iſrael</hi> for Life and Salvation till in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28, 29. Till then they are ſo far from <hi>a Covenant ſtate,</hi> which is of <hi>Life, Peace, Mercy, Salvation,</hi> Mal. 25. Iſa. 54. 10. and 55. 3. Luk. 1. 71, 72. Rom. 11. 26, 27. That they are declared to be in an oppoſite ſtate, they are at <hi>enmity, dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> and <hi>children of wrath</hi> as well as others, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 15, 16. <hi>Col.</hi> 1 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:48981:155"/>
This may appear further, by an enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the principal bleſſings of the New Covenant: it is promiſed there, that he will write his Law in their hearts, and be to them a God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. but till in Chriſt, they are <hi>without God in the World,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 12.</p>
               <p>The greateſt difficulty is, as to the great priviledge of <hi>Pardon or Remiſſion of ſin,</hi> under which the whole of <hi>Juſtification</hi> is ſignified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 27.</p>
               <p>Some think that we are <hi>juſtified from Eternity,</hi> others at <hi>the death of Chriſt:</hi> but <hi>actual perſonal Juſtification</hi> of a ſinner before God, is at his <hi>union with Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and the gift of Faith, not before. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>None are actually intereſted in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, before union with him and the gift of Faith:</hi> it is he that is <hi>made unto us righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. 2 Cor. 5. 21. if without Chriſt, then without his righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>By the righteouſneſs of one upon all unto Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Life;</hi> none therefore ever attain <hi>Juſtification</hi> without a righteouſneſs; For, it conſiſteth in a <hi>Divine declaration of a perſons being righteous;</hi> and if he were not ſo, it were a falſe Sentence, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible to the true God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:48981:155"/>
Neither will a righteouſneſs of his own working out (though by the help of Grace) ſerve for this end of Juſtification, but of that <hi>one</hi> Jeſus Chriſt: hence <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>By the obedience of one, many are made righteous?</hi> As, his ſuffering and death did make <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for ſin, ſo his obedience is <hi>a righteouſneſs</hi> meriting bleſſings, even Eternal Life, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. and it is called <hi>the righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> Phil. 3. 9. that being a means for our application of that righteouſneſs which is given, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22, 25, 26. Not that <hi>Faith</hi> is the meritorious, procuring cauſe of our Juſtification; it hath not the ſame cauſality therein, that Jeſus Chriſt hath. No more is required to the releaſe of our <hi>obligation</hi> it ſelf, than what <hi>the Law</hi> (by which we are obliged) doth exact, which is <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> as to Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Penalty; the ſolution thereof was by Jeſus Chriſt alone: but more is required partly to make way for this, <hi>viz. a compact or new Covenant</hi> concerning it, without which all ſufferings by another, had been of no advantage to us; partly as a means of application, <hi>viz. Faith,</hi> Rom. 10. 10. <hi>with the heart man believeth unto</hi> (i. e. as a means unto) <hi>righteouſneſs;</hi> and hence Juſtification is often ſaid to be <hi>by Faith,</hi> Rom. 3. 28. Rom. 5. 1. And the Queſtion
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48981:156"/>
then, was not how are men manifeſted and declared in their own Conſciences to be juſtified, but how are they <hi>juſtified</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and in his fight? and that is, not before, but by Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 11.</p>
               <p>The ſcope of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. is, to prove that we are <hi>juſtified by Faith and the righteouſneſs thereof, and not by works of the Law</hi> without cauſe of glorying, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. from the inſtances of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> ver. 3. for what ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 6. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>deſeribeth the bleſſedneſs of the man unto whom God imputeth righteouſneſs without Works.</hi> And here note, <hi>[Pardon of ſin]</hi> is not the whole of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> there is alſo neceſſary unto that end, <hi>a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> if it were of our own working out, then we were juſtified and ſaved by our own works (which the Scripture general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denyeth) this were to confound Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Sanctification; as if Jeſus Chriſt only ſatisfied for the ſins and defects of a righteouſneſs which we perform, ſo as that is accepted unto Life; whereas it is by a righteouſneſs of Faith, which is not of our own working out, but wrought out for us by Jeſus Chriſt. The falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets themſelves from among the Jews,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48981:156"/>
that urged theſe works of the Law upon the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> inſiſted much upon the ceremonials, which plainly impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an acknowledgement of ſin, and argueth that they did not expect Juſtification with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pardon, but carnally looked for pardon in the way of their own works; and the Apoſtle in oppoſition to them excludeth out of Juſtification, not only works wrought by their own natural power, but even thoſe which were by ſanctifying Grace; for the works of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> (who were believers) are here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some think the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, or his active obedience in our ſtead needleſs; unleſs as a part of his ſatisfaction for ſin, becauſe (ſay they) the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth not of us both ſuffering and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, <hi>The Law as a Covenant of Works, required ſuffering in ſatisfaction for ſin, and as it belongeth to the Covenant of Grace, ſo it requireth perfect obedience</hi> (to be fulfilled by Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Juſtification and Life of ſinners, and new obedience,</hi> (which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth to ſanctification) <hi>is to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſtians as the fruit and effect of their ſpiritual Life.</hi> Rather it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48981:157"/>
that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould fulfill righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs or yield <hi>active obedience</hi> to the Law as part of a <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for ſin, when by his <hi>paſſive obedience</hi> he underwent <hi>death,</hi> which was the very ſame and all that the Law threatned againſt the ſinner.</p>
               <p>If man had never violated or broken the Covenant of Works, or had never ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then the Law would have required only righteouſneſs of him for Life; the tenour of it being <hi>Do and Live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When man had ſinned, then the Law (at a Covenant of Works) required only ſuffering, and <hi>threatned death,</hi> Gen. 2. 17. but ceaſed in its <hi>promiſe of Life;</hi> that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately became null and void. It is true, the Law as a natural rule of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs required ſtill perfect obedience, that was due to God by right of Creation, and his ſinning could not free him from the obligation of it. It promiſed nothing to a ſinner; it would imply a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it ſhould promiſe Life to him ſtill upon perfect unſinning obedience, when he was already a ſinner under the threatning of Death. Yea, if immediately after <hi>Adams</hi> ſinning, <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> had been made, and he <hi>pardoned,</hi> yet he had been but <hi>in ſtatu quo prius,</hi> in his former ſtate; If the Covenant of Works had been in force again
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48981:157"/>
is at the firſt, he muſt afterward have yielded perfect obedience, elſe no promiſe of Life; and therefore there is no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, in ſaying, that man ſinning, the Law required <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for ſin, and yet alſo required <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> unto Life; much more in our caſe; for there is another Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> of Grace made with Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> wherein he hath undertaken by ſuffering to make ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for our ſin, without which we could never have been freed from the threatned death, there was no other way to it; the Lord might have refuſed a ſubſtitute, and therefore might (without any ſhew of injuſtice) put in what terms he pleaſed for our reſtoration unto Life.</p>
               <p>If freedom from <hi>threatned death</hi> were obtained, ſtill the Lord might have annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated us, we had <hi>no promiſe of Eternal Life;</hi> that in the Covenant of Works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing null and void, upon the tranſgreſſion of the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold therefore, the Lord agreeth to ſtand to the firſt terms; the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> undertaking to do what <hi>the firſt</hi> ſhould have done, to fulfill the ſame righteouſneſs, the Lord doth thereupon promiſe Life again. Thus the Law is drawn into the Covenant of Grace, and requireth the ſame perfect
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48981:158"/>
righteouſneſs as before, to be fulfilled not by our ſelves for Life, but by Jeſus Chriſt <hi>the ſecond Adam,</hi> as the aforementioned Scriptures do witneſs; which aſſert not only ſuffering, but alſo the righteouſneſs of that one Jeſus Chriſt to be neceſſary unto <hi>Juſtification and Life,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19, &amp;c. and hence the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant (which he fulfilled) did run in the firſt form of <hi>Do and Live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ground of this miſtake is a falſe ſuppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> that no more is needful unto Life, but <hi>ſatisfaction for our ſin and diſobedience;</hi> as if Life would naturally follow upon that, which is to ſay, either that we have Life without any <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> (whereas there is no Promiſe of it to <hi>Adam,</hi> or to any ſince, that run that way) or elſe that we have it by <hi>a righteouſneſs</hi> of our own working out, Chriſt ſatisfying for <hi>our ſins</hi> and defects therein, and this is to affirm that we have life ſtill by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works and in the way thereof, which to affirm is very anti-evangelical and unſcriptural; For, there are many Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, that unto the pardon of ſin there is needful <hi>a New Covenant,</hi> Heb. 8. 12. and that Life is by that, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs required to it, wrought out not by our ſelves, but by another for us, even Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:48981:158"/>
And thus the death of Jeſus Chriſt was needful to our freedom from death, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we obeyed in him, or he obeyed in our ſtead, to merit for us Eternal Life, which is promiſed thereupon, not now by the Old <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> but by the <hi>New Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus although Chriſt fulfilled <hi>the Law</hi> for us, ſo as it is imputed to us, and we <hi>made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. Yet it doth not follow that we ſhould be freed altogether from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of the Law unto obedience; For, the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, his obeying and fulfilling of the Law for us, was as the condition of Life, or that upon which the Lord hath promiſed Juſtification unto Life; but we may be (and are) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to obedience, not for that, but for other ends; not in the leaſt for our <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and title to Life;</hi> but as a part of our Sanctification; and we ſin in not obeying, that we may glorifie God by thoſe fruits of our being Spiritually alive. Chriſts obedience was for one end, ours is for another; as his ſufferings were for one end, our afflictions for another, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them unneceſſary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>No actual intereſt in the promiſes of the New and better Covenant before union
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48981:159"/>
with Jeſus Chriſt and Faith:</hi> Even the Elect of God ſo long as unconverted and <hi>without Chriſt</hi> are <hi>without promiſes,</hi> as I have manifeſted, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22. they were not from Eternity the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ver. 29. he had no Seed ſo early.</p>
               <p>If the ſinner himſelf had ſatisfied, then it had been no pardon; for he is not-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned that payeth his whole debt himſelf; but Jeſus Chriſt interpoſed, he underwent the Curſe, and the New Covenant or Free Promiſe, is Gods grant or act of Pardon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 11. and 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17. <hi>This is my Covenant—Their ſins and iniquities will I remember no more.</hi> Remiſſion of ſin then, is a glorious fruit and benefit of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> not only manifeſted but conferred thereby. <hi>God juſtifieth,</hi> Rom. 8. 33. and this is his <hi>pardoning act.</hi> Not Faith it ſelf or any Grace within us, is that which <hi>giveth</hi> the pardon: Faith only <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth</hi> the Remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 43. and the Divine gift of it is by an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing, even by the Promiſe of the <hi>New Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hence, if any Object, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt as a Surety, had the obligation of the Elect transferred upon him, and made full ſatisfaction to the Law for them, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled

it for holding them obliged, becauſe they cannot eventually be damned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is Anſwered, <hi>As our obligation and condemnation was by the Covenant of Works, ſo our declared freedom from its obligation, and our Juſtification, muſt be by the New Covenant;</hi> that is the way laid out for the giving of it forth. And though our ſin was transferred upon him, and an Act paſſed which rendred it certain, that we ſhould be juſtified (yea and ſanctified too) in due ſeaſon, yet not ſo, as that we were immediately diſobliged, but in the way laid out by Divine appointment for that end.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> being vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, though ſatisfaction muſt be given to that, yet that contained no Promiſe of Life to a ſinner upon anothers undergoing the very penalty threatned therein, and therefore was ſo far from giving <hi>ipſo facto</hi> deliverance, that it would have availed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards it, without <hi>a New Covenant,</hi> becauſe payment by a Surety was a refuſable ſatisfaction; the Lord (without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of injuſtice) might have ſaid, the Soul that hath ſinned it ſhall die. Therefore the Sentence of the Law lyeth againſt us, till by the Covenant of Grace we be diſcharged from it, in the way and

               <p>To ſay, therefore, that we are <hi>juſtified,</hi> not <hi>in our perſons,</hi> but <hi>to our perſons in Chriſt;</hi> is to grant what is deſired: For, men cannot be <hi>actually juſtified</hi> but in their own <hi>Perſons,</hi> and that cannot be till they actually exiſt and have perſonality: and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48981:161"/>
ſeeing, after their Nativity, their perſons are unjuſtified, they cannot at the ſame time be ſaid to be juſtified.</p>
               <p>Indeed the perſons were determined, Jeſus Chriſt had full aſſurance that he ſhould not die at uncertainties, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 11. But that doth not argue, the immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Juſtification, that is in the appointed ſeaſon.</p>

               <p>If it be Objected, <hi>That our obligation being transferred upon Jeſus Chriſt, and he having born our ſin and Curſe, juſtice and equity requireth that the Elect ſhould upon his death be</hi> ipſo facto <hi>actually diſcharged; their debt being paid, it cannot afterward be charged upon principal or Surety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:48981:162"/>
It may be Anſwered, <hi>More is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in this caſe than a meer debt,</hi> for here, <hi>the perſon was firſtly and principally under the obligation,</hi> as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> obſerveth, ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a Surety being accepted, the father might put in what terms he pleaſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſhew of injuſtice, and ſo there is no neceſſity that the diſcharge be <hi>ipſo facto</hi> upon his death.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>a debt</hi> may be charged upon <hi>the principal debtor,</hi> till he obtaineth an actual intereſt in the ſatisfaction of the Surety; till then, though no further <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> will ever be exacted from Jeſus Chriſt or the Elect, yet the <hi>Laws</hi> obligation unto wrath may lie againſt them for <hi>other ends;</hi> as to quicken them to ſeek deliverance out of that deplorable condition they are in. The want of an immediate freedom, is not from the defectiveneſs of the ſatisfaction made by Jeſus Chriſt, but from a preſent incapacity in thoſe who are to be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the freedom: as a full ranſom may be paid for Slaves, yet by reaſon of the diſtance, an after-day may be ſet for their releaſe; So, the Elect whilſt unborn are uncapable of being actually diſobliged; for the ſubjects muſt exiſt before even <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative change</hi> can paſs upon them; alſo,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48981:163"/>
after they are born, they are at a great diſtance from God, without making up of that, they are uncapable of an actual poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Redemption. As <hi>a common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> Jeſus Chriſt repreſented many that lived in ſeveral Ages of the World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of neceſſity the actual diſcharge of particular perſons muſt be at different times, not all at once, but when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Seed.</p>
               <p>Further, <hi>A debt may be charged upon the principal debtor by an Old Law, till a New Law or Covenant declareth his diſcharge from the obligation:</hi> Thus the Sentence of the violated <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> may ſtand againſt men, till they be declared to be diſcharged by <hi>the New Covenant,</hi> Heb. 10. 16, 17. Yea obſerve, Jeſus Chriſt in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death for our Redemption, ſtood <hi>as Mediatour of the New Teſtament,</hi> Heb. 9. 15. Though therein he ſatisfied for our break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Covenant with the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> as this was drawn into the Covenant of Grace, as the condition thereof.</p>
               <p>Once more, <hi>A debt may be charged upon the principal debtor, after a Sureties ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the obligation, in caſe the Sureties name was not at firſt in the ſame obligation, but is admitted afterward by voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:48981:163"/>
Covenant, and conſent;</hi> For, there the Covenant is the only determining rule of all matters concerning the diſcharge. Why are they not ſanctified and glorified immediately after their coming into the World (theſe being effects of the death of Chriſt) but becauſe the Covenant provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth otherwiſe?</p>
               <p>If the Name of Jeſus Chriſt (as as Surety) had been Originally or at firſt in <hi>Adams</hi> obligation, then more might have been ſaid for an immediate diſcharge upon his payment of our debt, and ſuffering death; but this was not the caſe, for if it had, then his ſuffering death had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and unavoidable, though no <hi>New Teſtament</hi> had ever been made, yea the making of it had been unneceſſary, vain, and uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>Whereas it was extreamly neceſſary, there could have been no transferring of our guilt to him, without it, and his ſubmitting to death was by <hi>a voluntary contract,</hi> Joh. 10. 17, 18. And his name not being at firſt in our bond, hence his payment was a refuſable ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>It was by an act of <hi>Free Grace</hi> that he was admitted to undertake for us, and his payment accepted in our ſtead, and ſo,

though he paid the <hi>idem,</hi> the ſame that we did owe, yet there was nothing contrary to juſtice or equity, if the Father added other terms than before, and ſo no need that we ſhould be <hi>ipſo facto</hi> diſcharged.

Neither will this be evaded by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Our ſin was imputed to Jeſus Chriſt before committed, and an actual exiſtence of ſin is no more requiſite unto our diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, than unto our obligation unto the puniſhment thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, <hi>The ſins of the Elect were not actually upon Jeſus Chriſt, till he came actually under the Law, which was their very obligation,</hi> Gal. 4. 4, 5. And thus all their ſin by that Law did meet upon him before committed; anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, when perſons <hi>do actually come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Covenant;</hi> I grant they are juſtified, yea even virtually from ſins not yet committed: but the Old Law of Works muſt needs be in force againſt them till a New diſchargeth from it, and this is not till union with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and the gift of Faith.</p>
               <p>And O how miſerable then, are all they who are out of Chriſt! they are in an unjuſtified eſtate, ſeeing they have no Word or Promiſe to aſſure them that the Lord hath laid down his Sute againſt them; but great is the happineſs of all in Chriſt, of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, in that they ſtand juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. verſ. 7. <hi>Bleſſed</hi>

                  <p>Of the evidences of intereſt in the New Covenant.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT may be Queſtioned, <hi>How or by what means may a Soul know its actual Intereſt in, and Title to the New and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Covenant, and the better promiſes thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the clearing of this, I ſhall not inſiſt upon the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of the <hi>Divine Spirit,</hi> which is the primary evidence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 8. nor upon <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,</hi> as it ſtandeth in ſpiritual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and inclinations for compliance with the Divine Will, either in cauſing an anſwerableneſs of heart, to what is commanded from us, (compriſed under a writing the Law there), or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Evangelical obedience in the Life, or bringing up a ſelf-reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 5. in tho Covenant it is expreſly promiſed, <hi>[they ſhall be my people].</hi> Theſe things are
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48981:166"/>
inſiſted upon elſewhere; yea, frequently by others, therefore I ſhall paſs them over at preſent, and mention only one evidence.</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>By the operations and actings of precious Faith, a Soul may have a clear knowledge of its actual intereſt in the New and better Covenant:</hi> That noble Grace of <hi>Faith</hi> hath ſuch a ſpecial relation to the Covenant, (which is made up of promiſes), that the Goſpel is called <hi>the Word of Faith,</hi> Rom. 10. 8. It is ſo expreſſive of the great matters of it, that <hi>Faith</hi> often and the <hi>Law or Old Covenant</hi> are the oppoſite terms of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. ver. 2, 5, 12, 23. Yea, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. they that are <hi>[of Faith] are bleſſed with faithful</hi> Abraham: they are ſharers with him in the ſame Covenant, and bleſſed therein: the very <hi>bleſſings of</hi> Abraham come on the Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>That we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Promiſe of the Spirit through Faith.</hi> Much is to be drawn out of the free Promiſe for our relief and ſuccour in any condition, yea for the influence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any other Graces, <hi>by Faith.</hi> By that, our entercouſe with God here is kept up: Not that the Promiſe is made to beliving as a Grace in us, or as a gracious Act put forth by us, but
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48981:167"/>
to the Believer as in Chriſt. <hi>Faith</hi> is not magnified as <hi>a quality,</hi> but as in the Office of <hi>receiving the Promiſe,</hi> and of excellent uſe therein. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>That the Promiſe through the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe. Faith</hi> is not then properly the <hi>condition</hi> of the Covenant, upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of which, they have a right and title to it; but a choice <hi>effect</hi> of it, and a ſingular means for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the promiſes, and fetching in of Covenant bleſſings to the Soul: by that, the Promiſe or what is in the Promiſe, is given to it, and Faith having thus to do with the Promiſes, it muſt needs have an aptitude above other Graces, above Sanctification and Evangelical obedience to witneſs a Souls intereſt in the everlaſting Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. It is an <hi>evidence of things not ſeen;</hi> and therefore it ſelf is not as <hi>inevident</hi> as thoſe other things.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>various acts of Faith,</hi> that by the concurrence of the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may <hi>evidence</hi> intereſt in the Covenant.</p>

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48981:168"/>
ſtood off from him, is then brought over to him by the Goſpel, and why? <hi>[For therein is the righteouſneſs of God revealed from Faith to Faith].</hi> It is in a Goſpel-Glaſs that a Soul gaineth a right diſcovery of the excellency of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and that righteouſneſs of his without which no Salvation. It is by Faith that there is a learning of the Father, ſo as effectually to be drawn unto the Son. This cordial conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the offer of the Goſpel, in <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting</hi> to the <hi>obediential righteouſneſs</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt alone for acceptation unto Life, this is Faith unto <hi>Juſtification,</hi> Rom. 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4, 6, 10. as the like conſent to have him for our <hi>Lord</hi> to rule over us by his Spirit dwelling in us, is Faith unto <hi>Sanctification,</hi> Act. 15. 9. Rom. 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 9, to 16. Thus the Soul maketh out to the blood of Jeſus Chriſt for cleanſing from all ſin; and the firſt act of cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt is by Faith in a Free Promiſe that is the firſt Grace that lives in it the firſt breathings of Spiritual Life are thereby: ſuch powerful and admirable alterations are found at firſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Jeſus Chriſt, by diſcoveries above ſenſe, fetching in the heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48981:168"/>
him beyond all other means, that they muſt needs be evidencing of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the Promiſe or Covenant from whence all theſe come. Such firſt things have a mark upon them, and often are moſt diſcernable, the ſtate thereupon being ſo vaſtly different from what it was, how refined ſo ever the nature was before.</p>
               <p>Thus ſome have had their intereſt cleared up in ſuch a word as that, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying and worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the eye of Faith a Soul gaineth ſuch a proſpect of matchleſs Love and Free Grace, as it is won over to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt thereby, through a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful application of the Promiſe to it ſelf, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 10, 11. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath the witneſs in himſelf;</hi> he being inabled by Grace to entertain and cordially ſubſcribe to the bleſſed record upon a Divine Teſtimony, <hi>viz.</hi> that God hath given to us Eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſetteth to his Seal that God is true in the Word of his Grace, that hath <hi>a witneſſing power,</hi> and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath the <hi>witneſs</hi> within himſelf, even when he ſometimes doth not diſcern it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:48981:169"/>
2. <hi>By Faith the Soul maketh out to Jeſus Chriſt in the Free Promiſe, as he alone that giveth it ſubſiſtence in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Life:</hi> Oneneſs with Jeſus Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>[In whom] are given to us exceeding great and precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Partakers of the Promiſe in Chriſt.</hi> Ver. 17. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your heart by Faith.</hi> It is a promiſe-hold that we have of Jeſus Chriſt here, his in-being and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling is by Faith; ſo he even ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth the Souls of Saints, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> how? <hi>I live by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi> Others live by ſenſe, they ſeed upon earthly comforts, but Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians live by Faith; by what is laid up in <hi>Divine Promiſes,</hi> by theſe things they live; they know not how to ſubſiſt in any ſtate or condition without a Promiſe: they would count themſelves dead creatures without that, whatever earthly enjoyments they had in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Neither will a Promiſe alone ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie without Jeſus Chriſt in it, <hi>[Chriſt liveth in me],</hi> he is the very Life of their lives: without him nothing but ſpiritual ſwoonings, faintings, dyings,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48981:169"/>
and all from the want, and failings, of Faith. That fetcheth in all <hi>influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> from Jeſus Chriſt for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, and hath the great hand and ſtroak in all the actings, of ſpiritual Life; all ſpiritual motions are managed thereby, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sanctification is but a ſecondary or after evidence. That is not diſcernable till firſt there be a diſcerning Faith, which ſpeaketh Juſtification. If Faith be <hi>inevident,</hi> all other Graces will be ſo alſo.</p>
               <p>Faith may be ſhewed unto others by Works, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 18. A man may be <hi>Declaratively</hi> juſtified by Works, but if a man doubteth of his Faith, he will as well doubt of his Works, whether they be from a Goſpel root or not? For, no Love of the right ſtamp (and ſo no due obedience) but what is the fruit and iſſue of Faith in the Lord Jeſus; For, that <hi>worketh by Love,</hi> Gal. 5. 6.</p>
               <p>As firſt acts of Faith, do not conſiſt in believing that our ſins are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in <hi>a receiving</hi> Jeſus Chriſt and his righteouſneſs as the way to pardon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. So, if Chriſtians kept up in acts of Faith by outgoings of heart to him in the way of the Promiſe for all
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48981:170"/>
that is wanted, there would be not only ſweet flowings of Love and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical obedience iſſuing thence; but alſo they would be filled with <hi>all joy and peace in believing,</hi> Rom. 15. 13.</p>
               <p>I have often thought, if Chriſtians did give more attendance to ſuch <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect acts of Faith,</hi> and ſpent leſs time in queſtioning their conditions, or giving way to doubtings about them, they would find their intereſt in the Covenant cleared up, yea and conſolation alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in as by the by.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>By Faith Souls are venturing upon the Free Grace and faithfulneſs of God, in his Covenant in the greateſt diſtreſſes with good ſucceſs:</hi> The New Covenant is made up all of Promiſes, and the Goſpel is called the Word of Faith, becauſe it is the Work of Faith to draw out what is veſſeled up there, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38. <hi>Now the Juſt ſhall live by Faith.</hi> Not only as to Juſtification, but as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of mercy promiſed. Many would be acting Faith in the concluding intereſt in Chriſt and Eternal Life, but they ſhould be acting it by a cordial owning of Evangelical principles; Yea, Chriſtians ſhould lead their whole Life in looking to the Love and Faithfulneſs
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48981:170"/>
of God in his Promiſe for all their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and ſuccour in any condition they come into here, yea even for Eternal Mercy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. They are purſued by ſpiritual enemies, corruptions, and Temptations, and are in great danger, but <hi>by hope</hi> (which floweth from <hi>Faith,</hi> and can act no higher than <hi>Faith</hi> doth) they go, yea run <hi>for refuge,</hi> to the <hi>hope,</hi> to the heavenly glory that is ſet before them, ſo as they lie as at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chour</hi> in ſuch ſtormy daies; and here are <hi>two immutable things,</hi> the Promiſe and the <hi>Oath</hi> of God, that by theſe they might have ſtrong conſolation. By Faith they realize the very things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Promiſe or Covenant, and ſo their intereſt in it is experimentally witneſſed to them. They can ſay, at ſuch a time when we were in Soul diſtreſs, ſo as all the means in the World could contribute nothing towards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eaſe, quietment and conſolation; then we being inabled by Grace to bear the weight of our Souls, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions upon the Faithfulneſs of God in his Covenant or Free Promiſe, we found relief and refreſhment. It was not meerly our own fancy and imagination, but we were delivered out of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes;
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48981:171"/>
by Faith we were inabled to draw out of the Promiſe, the Milk of conſolation, which it was beyond the power of all creatures to afford us, and thus they find that the Covenant or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is their own.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>By Faith in the Free Promiſe, there is a ſtanding Conquerours in Jeſus Chriſt over all ſpiritual enemies:</hi> it is a great matter of the Covenant, that the <hi>Seed of the Woman</hi> ſhould break <hi>the Serpents bead,</hi> Gen. 3. 15. And therefore there is (through Grace) a vanquiſhing all the enemies of Salvation, Sin, and Satan, through <hi>the bleſſed Seed</hi> the Lord Jeſus. The Promiſes are accompliſhed within the Soul, but the way is <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Above all take the Shield of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That not only is beſt for deſcrying Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in all his Stratagems, but for the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of him alſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>This is the Victory that overcometh the World, even our Faith.</hi> When the Soul hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, or Spiritual Conflicts, and reaſon is foiled, cannot bear up, then Faith appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as Victorious, not in its own ſtrength, but in the ſtrength of Chriſt and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, which it maketh uſe of in theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters. And thus <hi>conquering acts of Faith,</hi> as before <hi>venturing, relieving, and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48981:171"/>
diſcovering acts,</hi> are uſeful for witneſſing intereſt in the Covenant.</p>
               <p>I might ſhew that Faith hath other acts, as, <hi>acts of aſſurance,</hi> drawing up concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he hath <hi>loved me, and given himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2. 20.

intimated. <hi>Abſolute Promiſes</hi> are high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Divine Love, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 11, 12. They proclaim <hi>rich mercy and great Love,</hi> Eph. 2. 4, 5. That the Lord ſhould break through all unworthineſs and undeſervings, this may work into the greateſt ſelf-empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſelf-abaſement. The Lord peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily promiſed the eſtabliſhing of <hi>Davids</hi> throne for ever, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 13, 16. and this Grace melts his heart into a deep ſenſe of his own nothingneſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19. <hi>Who am I, O Lord God; what is my houſe, &amp;c. Thou haſt ſpoken alſo of thy Servants houſe for a great while to come, and is this the manner of man, O Lord God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that <hi>abſolute Promiſes</hi> of Divine Grace are of great efficacy to render deeply hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and abaſed; and he breaketh forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to admiration of God on this account, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>Wherefore thou art great, O Lord, for there is none like thee—</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the abſoluteneſs of the Promiſes, ſetteth forth the excellency of the <hi>New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> above the <hi>Old;</hi> and the gloriouſneſs of this diſpenſation above any that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: ſo it may help againſt that temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to live in the Spirit of the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and it is mentioned in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They are of uſe in the impartation or
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:48981:172"/>
communication of firſt Grace unto the Souls of men:</hi> their firſt intereſt therein, is by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious operations of the Spirit <hi>in abſolute Promiſes.</hi> Theſe are called by ſome, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Grace,</hi> which preſuppoſe a being without it, thus <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 11, 12. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before writing <hi>the Law in the heart,</hi> another Law of ſin was found in its <hi>power</hi> there. The moment before the Lords becoming <hi>their God,</hi> they were without God in the world <hi>(Eph.</hi> 2. 12.) The inſtant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the remiſſion of ſin,</hi> the guilt of it was found there. All firſt Grace is compriſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe Promiſes, ſo that the bringing Souls over to a firſt cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s by an <hi>abſolute Promiſe:</hi> though they may have their eyes upon thoſe called <hi>conditional Promiſes</hi> in converſion, yet if ever they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at any Drachme of eſpecial Grace, it is in an <hi>abſolute</hi> way; it is the fruit, the reſult and iſſue of an <hi>abſolute Promiſe:</hi> for as all firſt Grace is contained therein, ſo till that be accompliſhed upon them, no qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications or conditions are wrought in their Souls altering their ſtate, or which are acceptable and pleaſing unto God. The inſtant before <hi>quickening,</hi> Souls were <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> Eph. 2. 4. Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before <hi>reconciliation,</hi> they ſtood at <hi>enmity</hi> againſt the Lord, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. The moment
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48981:173"/>
before <hi>Sanctification</hi> they were <hi>under ſin</hi> and pollution. It is groundleſly therefore, that any Souls ſtand off from Jeſus Chriſt and the Free Promiſe, upon the account of a want of any <hi>qualifications;</hi> they ſhould rather immediately cloſe with him therein, as the way to <hi>gracious qualifications</hi> which are derived to them through the <hi>abſolute Promiſe.</hi> The Lord is a free Agent, may work how he pleaſeth, but hath not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted any Souls to ſtay one moment before cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt, upon the want of any qualification, or upon any account whatſoever: indeed if he had, then he muſt teſtifie his allowance of their perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo long in <hi>unbelief;</hi> whereas that hateful and abominable to him.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>They are of Uſe as a provocation to ſeek, and a direction where to find, all ſupplies of Grace wanted:</hi> Other Promiſes may referr to ſome particular ſtate or condition, but there are <hi>abſolute Promiſes</hi> that are of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raluſe, whatever the condition or compliant be, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 11, 12. As firſt Grace is promiſed there, ſo all after degrees of it, in that of writing <hi>the Law in the heart.</hi> As firſt intereſt in God is promiſed, in that of his being <hi>their God,</hi> ſo all after communion with him is included in it. As <hi>firſt Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> is promiſed, in his remembring ſin no
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:48981:173"/>
more, ſo all after <hi>remiſſion of ſin</hi> that is afforded to thoſe in Covenant with him.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>abſolute Promiſes</hi> are uſeful at all times; when Souls are ready to ſay, What have we to do with other Promiſes, there is enough in theſe to help and ſuccour in all caſes, when Souls are at the greateſt loſs, and cannot find other Promiſes mentioning their particular conditions; to be ſure, they muſt either want ſome Grace, or fellowſhip with God or pardon of ſin; and the <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Promiſes</hi> extend and reach to all theſe; that they are a ſtanding relief, bread that never fail, waters that are for ever ſure; all is laid up here that ſouls can groundedly deſire at the hands of God.</p>
               <p>And being <hi>Abſolute,</hi> they are Free Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, no diſcouragement laid in the way of ſouls for cloſing with them. Often men do ungroundedly take diſcouragement for meddling with other Promiſes, becauſe they cannot ſee that they have <hi>the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> which they are annexed to; but to be ſure thoſe that are <hi>abſolute,</hi> do not preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any ſuch qualifications as neceſſarily antecedaneous to the cloſing with them, but they promiſe all gracious qualifications that ſouls have the deepeſt ſenſe of the want of. Whatever Grace or degree of it they want, it is here; they are directed to turn in hither.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:48981:174"/>
No ground to ſtand off from theſe one moment upon the account of a want of <hi>humiliation,</hi> &amp;c. but the rather ſhould they repair hither for it, and for firſt Grace when they ſeem to be without it, for Evangelical ſorrow, and all ſpiritual frames of heart deſirable; when there is nothing diſcerned as the qualification but <hi>ſinfulneſs,</hi> then they had the more need look to, and faſten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord in <hi>abſolute Promiſes,</hi> that all deſirable qualifications may be wrought within them. How ſhould they obtain theſe, but by looking to the Free Promiſe? The <hi>abſolute Promiſes</hi> are theirs, ſo far as to make uſe of them, and venture upon the Lord in them, for the obtainment of Grace wanted; though they <hi>cannot claim</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ſo as to conclude a good eſtate thence, or that Grace is injoyed, before a powerful application of them.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>They are uſeful for the ſtrengthening againſt, and ſupporting under all temptations that gracious Souls can be attended with:</hi> If it be ſuggeſted, that the Promiſe is none of theirs, they have nothing to do to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with it. Here is enough to anſwer, poſſibly other Promiſes may be theirs, though at preſent they cannot diſcern it; there are ſuch cloudings, as <hi>all experiences, all qualifications</hi> may be out of ſight; they
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:48981:174"/>
may thus <hi>ſit in darkneſs and ſee no light,</hi> and yet may be Children of light, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 10. But <hi>however</hi> though they cannot claim any Promiſe ſo as to conclude intereſt in Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Eternal Life thence, yet they may, ſo far as to ſeek an intereſt therein. The <hi>abſolute Promiſe</hi> is theirs in the offer of it, if they ſhould yet be without the ſpecial Grace offered therein. All, where the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel cometh, have ſo far a right and Title to the <hi>abſolute Promiſe,</hi> as it is their duty to faſten upon it, for the begetting all graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous qualifications that they ſeem to be or are without, elſe they could not be blamed, condemned, and puniſhed for unbelief, as many are, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Ro.</hi> 11. 20.</p>
               <p>If the temptation be, that it would be <hi>preſumption</hi> to meddle with the Promiſe which is none of thine:</p>
               <p>It is anſwered, thou art to look to the Lord in the <hi>abſolute Promiſe,</hi> that it may be thine, that Grace may be thine, that God may be thy God, that pardon of ſin may be thine, though thou canſt not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern at preſent, that theſe are thine.</p>
               <p>Such a looking to the Promiſe, as thence to take incouragement to indulge itſelf, or perſiſt in ſin, this indeed is preſumption; but a cordial looking to the Lord in, and venturing to take hold of the abſolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:48981:175"/>
for the gaining a freedom from ſin, and every gracious frame, this is duty, and the neglecting of it is preſumption, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtanding out againſt a Divine Call.</p>
               <p>There is a ground for putting forth <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect acts of Faith</hi> upon the Lord in <hi>the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Promiſe</hi> for all Grace wanted. When there is not a preſent diſcerning by a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexive act,</hi> that gracious qualifications are injoyed, yet there may be an outgoing of heart in the Promiſe to God in Jeſus Chriſt for them, or that they may be afforded. It is a great miſtake, to think that we are to exerciſe Faith upon the Lord in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, only upon a ſight of a condition in our ſelves; this were to ground our Faith rather upon ſomething of our own, than upon the Lord in his Free Promiſe; it were to ſubject the <hi>abſolute Promiſes</hi> and make them depend upon thoſe that are called <hi>conditional</hi> as to their efficacy and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, whereas the truth lieth the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way; for the New Covenant is as it were the Fountain of all the Promiſes to us, and that runneth altogether upon <hi>abſolute Promiſes,</hi> and therefore thoſe which are called <hi>conditional Promiſes,</hi> being ſtreams flowing thence, and branches of that Tree, they muſt be reducible to, and partake of the Nature of the New Covenant, and ſo
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:48981:175"/>
are <hi>really abſolute</hi> in themſelves, only as a quickening means to our ſeeking after the bleſſings of them, they are repreſented ſometimes as if they were diſpenced out in <hi>a conditional way:</hi> but the Lord doth not confine himſelf to that way, for when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was deſtitute of commendable qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had failed in the worſhip of God, and wearied him with their ſins, yet he turned their eye upon an abſolute Promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 25. <hi>I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for my Names ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. <hi>They are of Uſe for the evidencing intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, and clearing up how the caſe ſtande thas to their Eternal conditions:</hi> The Lord can make a ſaving change <hi>(i. e.</hi> ſuch as hath Salvation and Eternal Life, infallibly in connexion with it) in the opening of any Promiſe, but it is from <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Grace.</hi> The begetting of Faith, or firſt Grace in the Souls of any, is by an <hi>abſolute Promiſe;</hi> For, what <hi>condition</hi> can there be, in any Soul before firſt Grace, to have a Promiſe annexed to it? It were to fruſtrate and make void the undertaking of Jeſus Chriſt, to aſſert, that the Lord hath promiſed Eternal Life to a work of nature, or that Souls are in a ſtate of Salvation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore union with Jeſus Chriſt, which they muſt be, if they had any qualification
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48981:176"/>
which had Salvation certainly promiſed to it. The Lord ſaith, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh.</hi> What precedent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification was here, but <hi>ſtonyneſs and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart,</hi> and ſo uncleanneſs before the <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> ver. 25. Here then is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of firſt Grace, and it is <hi>abſolute,</hi> and the operations of the Spirit herein are ſo ſupernatural and tranſcendently glorious as they are evidencing. The Word of the Goſpel cometh in ſuch power, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing the very end which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is appointed to, and there are ſuch ſparklings of Divine excellency in the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> that are made upon the Spirits of men hereby, that without having recourſe to any other promiſes (which are called con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional) they may read or ſee their perſonal intereſt in an abſolute Promiſe. By its efficacious application or the fulfilling of it, by their actual injoyment of what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, they may diſcern their ſharing in it. And ſeeing all <hi>gracious qualifications</hi> are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten or firſt wrought by an abſolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, why ſhould not that give evidence, as well as the after ſanctified frames?</p>
               <p>Beſides, the <hi>abſolute Promiſes</hi> are made
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48981:176"/>
to ſome perſons, even <hi>to the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and</hi> Judah, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 21, to the end, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. and being expreſſions of the <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Will</hi> of God, hence they muſt needs be evidencing; For, the chief intendment of Promiſes, is, to give aſſurance how the heart of God ſtandeth towards perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them; the Lord is ever ſpeaking to them therein after this manner, <hi>I will be your God, and your ſins and iniquities will I remember no more,</hi> Ezek. 36. 28. Heb. 8. 12. This is the natural Language of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to them. And, though unbelievers (who are out of Covenant) may fancy the ſame things, and delude themſelves, yet this hindreth not, but that the Lord may really ſpeak thus to Believers, who are undoubtedly under it. So ſometimes, the ſtate or condition of a Soul is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced, by ſuch Words or Promiſes as theſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 10. <hi>Be not diſmayed, for [I am thy God]</hi> Ezek. 34. 31. <hi>I am your God ſaith the Lord God.</hi> Iſai. 44. 22. <hi>I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and as a cloud thy ſins,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Divine Spirit oftentimes maketh ſuch a powerful application of ſuch promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and maketh ſuch glorious diſcoveries, of the loving kindneſs and free grace of God to the ſoul, as he giveth it clearly to
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48981:177"/>
underſtand that God is ſpeaking to it therein, and it is the voice of God and not of man or of Satan, and thus it is evidencing.</p>
               <p>The Lord is ſo <hi>ſhining</hi> upon his own <hi>graces,</hi> as then a ſoul uſually can diſcern theſe; yet it is not meerly a reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on faith or other graces, that now give the evidence; but faith receiveth it as it were upon a Divine teſtimony.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>They are of uſe for the filling ſouls with conſolation in the ſaddeſt conditions, and under the moſt trying diſpenſations: Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> was ſent to propheſie of the Jewiſh captivity, procured by their ſin, for the ſpace of ſeventy years, yet to keep them from deſpair and utter deſpondency, and to comfort them againſt all their trials, he not only aſſureth them of a return, but propheſieth of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and its being put into an <hi>abſolute</hi> form, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. Therefore the abſolute promiſes are of <hi>comforting uſe</hi> againſt the ſaddeſt trials that ſin it ſelf may bring us under. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle turneth their eye upon thoſe <hi>two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable things,</hi> the <hi>Promiſe</hi> and the <hi>Oath</hi> of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. as thoſe which the Lord appointed on purpoſe to uſher in <hi>ſtrong conſolation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:48981:177"/>
Thus we ſee, that when the Condition of ſinners ſeemeth moſt deſpicable, and when the graces of Saints are moſt out of ſight, yet then they may have recourſe to the <hi>Abſolute Promiſes,</hi> and look unto the Lord therein, for all grace and ſupply that is wanted.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of thoſe that are called Conditional Promiſes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>SOme may inquire what uſe is there, of thoſe called Conditional Promiſes? Or, when and in what caſes are they to be made uſe of?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>Some of them are of diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe what an extenſiveneſs there is in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace, ſutable to all the worſt conditions that ſouls can come into:</hi> the converſion of a ſoul of God, ordinarily is not without a ſpecial diſcovery of ſin, and a loſt undone condition by nature, in a Goſpel glaſs, yea a work of evangelical repentance is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced there.</p>
               <p>Alſo there may be ſometimes a common work, <hi>a legal conviction of ſin,</hi> before and without a ſaving change; but that in the ordinary way of Gods diſpenſation there is a neceſſity hereof, on our part, ſo as if we do not find it, we muſt ſtay for it, till we have it, may not be looking to Jeſus Chriſt, or meddle with the promiſe, yea as
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:48981:178"/>
if it were <hi>preſumption</hi> to attempt believing, that we may be (as many are) ſhy of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and the free promiſe, and ſtand off from them, this I ſee no rule yet for. I think <hi>the worſt of ſinners</hi> (even unſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ones) are immediately under the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations and calls</hi> of the Goſpel, for they may be condemned for <hi>unbelief,</hi> as ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out againſt them. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 3, 4, 9, 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17, 20.</p>
               <p>Many Scriptures alledged for the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch <hi>preparations</hi> before converſion, are mentioned <hi>as conditional promiſes;</hi> Whereas thoſe are not reſtrictive, do not reſtrain the promiſes to thoſe that are ſo qualified, but rather declare, that large and ſuitable ſupplies are to be had in Jeſus Chriſt, even in ſuch conditions when it ſeemeth moſt unlikely.</p>
               <p>And of ſuch uſe are theſe words, Iſai. 55. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Ho every one that thirſt come,</hi> &amp;c. There <hi>thirſting,</hi> was no deſirable qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it was for that which did <hi>not ſatisfie,</hi> they laboured for that which <hi>was not bread,</hi> verſ. 2. and yet are invited immediately to come to him, as to one that hath a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſupplies, <hi>water and wine</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, <hi>milk</hi> to nouriſh, and all offered free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without mony, and without price.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:48981:179"/>
Thus Matth. 11. 28. <hi>Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I give you reſt.</hi> Many are ready to think, that they ſhould ſeek to be thus <hi>weary, and heavy laden,</hi> and till then they may not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to <hi>come</hi> unto Jeſus Chriſt. Whereas it doth not appear, that theſe were any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable or commendable qualifications to be ſought after; but rather are expreſſions of their ſad conditions, and yet here is revealed ſutable relief in Jeſus Chriſt; if they be <hi>weary and heavy laden</hi> (not only <hi>by ſin,</hi> but) with the yoke of <hi>the Law</hi> (though unduly impoſed upon them by the Phariſees) yet coming to Jeſus Chriſt they might have reſt; and ſo whatever other burthen, they had ſinfully pulled upon themſelves. And beſides, <hi>the promiſe</hi> is not in this or the other text, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to <hi>thirſting or wearineſs,</hi> but to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> unto Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid to be anointed to preach <hi>glad tidings</hi> for the <hi>meek or the poor,</hi> Iſai. 61. 1. Luke 4. 18. and to heal <hi>the broken hearted,</hi> not only by a ſenſe of ſin; but <hi>broken</hi> by <hi>affliction, and diſtreſs, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prations,</hi> any way. His ſcope is not, to reſtrain the promiſe, as if it did belong only to thoſe that are thus qualified; but to ſhew, that the grace of Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:48981:179"/>
reacheth and is ſuitable to thoſe in ſuch deplorable conditions. Theſe are not frames to be ſought after, any more than thoſe that follow, of being <hi>Captives, blind, bruiſed,</hi> but conſider men under whatever notion of miſery you can, and here is declared, that there are thoſe very ſupplies to be had in Jeſus Chriſt that are ſuitable and relative thereunto; as <hi>reſt for the weary,</hi> ſo <hi>ſight for the blind, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for the captives,</hi> and theſe take in the worſt, even unſenſible ſinners; he by diſcoveries of his grace, bringeth them into a due ſenſe of ſin.</p>
               <p>Thus Matth. 5. 3, 4, 6. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, and thoſe that mourn,</hi> &amp;c. Not that theſe note <hi>Conditions</hi> properly, upon coming up to which, they have right to promiſed bleſſedneſs, elſe not; for, among others, <hi>perſecution</hi> hath the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs twice annexed to it, verſ. 10, 11. and <hi>outward poverty</hi> is partly intended; <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 20, 21. as is evident by the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis or oppoſition, verſ. 24, 25. <hi>Wo to you rich,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and you that are full.</hi> Yet, who will ſay, that poverty or perſecution are deſireable, and to be ſought that we might injoy the bleſſedneſs, by coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the condition of it? Nor can one ſay, I am <hi>poor,</hi> therefore bleſſed, more than

                  <hi>perſecuted</hi> therefore bleſſed. Theſe are not qualifications giving right and title to the promiſe, and without which they have it not; but theſe things are ſpoken to the <hi>diſciples,</hi> verſ. 20. the promiſes are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to diſcipleſhip, or to the perſon <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> rather than to his <hi>qualification of mourning,</hi> &amp;c. and whereas they (who before had a right in Chriſt to all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes) might be tempted to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unhappy by theſe things, here is a diſcovery that the ſeeming ſadneſs of theſe conditions, as <hi>poverty, perſecution,</hi> &amp;c. did not exclude from the promiſed bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; there is ſuitable relief for them in the promiſe ſtill. Hence in oppoſition to theſe, there are woes denounced againſt others in the oppoſite conditions, which to outward appearance ſeemed better, as againſt the <hi>rich,</hi> thoſe that are <hi>full,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And thus, theſe ſeeming conditions, in ſtead of being limitations of the promiſe, they are diſcoveries of the extenſiveneſs thereof; holding forth ſupplied and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours for ſouls in Chriſt, under their ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt trials and temptations, and in all the various, and worſt conditions they can come into, though not upon the condition of their coming into them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:48981:180"/>
The following particulars are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood when ſomething of <hi>ſpecial grace</hi> is mentioned, as if it were <hi>a condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Some called Conditional Promiſes are of declarative uſe what a high approbation the Lord hath of the perſons or things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them:</hi> thus, ſpeaking promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to profeſſors, ſome of which are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, others not, ſometimes it is with an <hi>[if]</hi> as Heb. 3. 6. <hi>[If] we hold faſt our confidence unto the end.</hi> To note, that perſeverance, in <hi>holding faſt,</hi> is a character of ſound believers, in oppoſition to others who do apoſtatize and fall away. Thus ſome Scriptures contain a deſcription of the perſons who ſhall obtain thoſe bleſſings of the Covenant, they are ſuch as are found <hi>believing, repenting, obeying,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to thoſe which are <hi>infidels, diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient,</hi> &amp;c. as Heb. 5. 9. <hi>He became the author of eternal ſalvation to them that obey him.</hi> Thoſe that are in a ſtate of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are characterized by ſuch effects as <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> ſuch words conclude <hi>Negatively,</hi> they that have not theſe in ſome degree, are not ſaved ones, but the promiſes are made rather to their <hi>perſons</hi> in Chriſt, than to their <hi>qualifications</hi> (as <hi>believing, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,)</hi> though theſe are neceſſary for the perſons: as it behoved the great High-Prieſt
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:48981:181"/>
even Jeſus Chriſt, (who had the promiſes made to him) to be <hi>holy, harm leſs, undefiled,</hi> yet they are not made to him upon the <hi>condition</hi> of his <hi>holineſs, or undefiledneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I would add, that ſuch promiſes do teſtifie how acceptable theſe acts are to the Lord, as being <hi>duties</hi> commanded by him, though they be not properly <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> upon which Covenant mercy is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to us. Will any ſay, that nothing is acceptable unleſs it be performed under the notion of <hi>a condition</hi> upon which the Lord hath obliged himſelf to give our mercy?</p>
               <p>Thus many Scriptures that ſeem to run in <hi>a Conditional</hi> form, are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: as <hi>Coloſs.</hi> 1. 21, 22, 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. they declare his <hi>approbation</hi> of <hi>faith, hope, obedience,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>They are of exciting and incouraging uſe to the duty of ſeeking in an abſolute promiſe thoſe gracious qualifications which the other promiſes are annexed to:</hi> the ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conditional expreſſions are not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as diſcouragements, but as powerful provoqations and incouragements to that duty, or ſeeking that grace conjoyned with the promiſe. Whatſoever mercy is mentioned any where either with or as a
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:48981:181"/>
condition, is <hi>abſolutely promiſed,</hi> in the New Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. particularly the <hi>remiſſion of ſin</hi> is promiſed there, yet it is ſaid, Matth. 6. 14, 15. <hi>If ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly father will alſo forgive you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Not as if <hi>divine pardons</hi> were ſuſpended till we have forgiven others, that ſo long any were unpardoned, and ſo condemned who before were juſtified. This were to make <hi>divine acts have dependence on our actings, and ſo to ſubject</hi> (as one ſaith) <hi>the Creator to the creature.</hi> Our forgiving others is not properly a condition, as if a performance of ours did <hi>ingage</hi> the Lord or lay him under <hi>an obligation</hi> to forgive us; or as if we had <hi>right</hi> and might lay <hi>claim</hi> to Divine remiſſion upon ſuch an act of ours: but, it is expreſſed in <hi>a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional form</hi> as a preſſing argument and a quickning ſpurr to ſo neceſſary a duty as the forgiving others, although the Lord hath <hi>abſolute intentions</hi> to pardon us, and to cauſe us to forgive others.</p>
               <p>Thus many other Scriptures are to be underſtood, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 31. <hi>Mark</hi> 11. 26. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 37. thus <hi>repenting and blotting out of ſins</hi> are conjoyned, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
               <p>As a Father, who is abſolutely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and reſolved to afford ſome great
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48981:182"/>
favor to his ſon, yet may ſpeak of it to him with an <hi>[if,]</hi> that he may lay an aw upon him towards ſome <hi>duty,</hi> which yet is not in the leaſt the <hi>condition</hi> of his afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>They are of directive uſe unto the right way and means of ſeeking the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies promiſed:</hi> the <hi>eternal decrees</hi> of God are <hi>not conditional</hi> but <hi>abſolute</hi> and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable, yet are not excluſive of all <hi>means</hi> in order to their execution in time. So, <hi>Divine promiſes</hi> which are abſolute, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>condition</hi> properly ſo called, yet are not fulfilled without any <hi>means.</hi> It is a groſs miſtake to think, that if there be no condition to be performed by us, then we need not take any care, or trouble our ſelves about the matters. For, we muſt know, there are Divine <hi>commands</hi> putting upon the uſe of <hi>means</hi> in order to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of abſolute promiſes; and, thoſe that are called <hi>conditional promiſes</hi> are of this uſe to <hi>declare,</hi> in what <hi>way</hi> and by what <hi>means</hi> thoſe great favours ſhall be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to us: and men neglecting to ſeek mercy in the way of Divine appointment, may miſs of it, not becauſe they have failed of performing <hi>a condition,</hi> but have neglected <hi>a duty,</hi> and by ſinning provoked God to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:48981:182"/>
The promiſes of firſt grace, are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted to be <hi>abſolute;</hi> for, if they did run upon any condition, that muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed before union with Jeſus Chriſt, yea that muſt be ſeen in the ſoul before it had a ground to meddle with the promiſe; and ſo it ſhould be aſcertained of ſalvation whilſt it is in a ſtate of nature. If <hi>faith</hi> were ſuppoſed <hi>the condition,</hi> that then muſt be prae exiſtent in the ſoul and diſcerned alſo, before it had a ground to believe in the promiſe that it were the condition of; whereas <hi>faith</hi> is a grace and is the fruit of a promiſe as well as any other graces. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the promiſes of firſt grace (though abſolute, yet) ſeem to be <hi>as conditionally</hi> propounded as any. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. herein, is holden forth <hi>the way and means</hi> to the obtainment of ſalvation; for it is propounded and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered indefinitely, to all, elect and not elect; not particularly promiſed to any, but as it turneth into an abſolute form to thoſe perſons deſcribed as the ſubjects of it.</p>
               <p>Thus the Lord giveth forth <hi>a cluſter of abſolute promiſes,</hi> Ezek. 36. 25, 26, 27, <hi>&amp;c. Then will I ſprinkle clean water upon you, and you ſhall be clean—a new heart alſo will I give you,</hi> &amp;c. and yet <hi>verſ.</hi> 37.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48981:183"/>
                  <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will yet for this be inquired of by the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to do it for them.</hi> This inquiring, is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned properly as <hi>a condition,</hi> for all was before unalterably determined, but as the way and means to the fruition of what was <hi>abſolutely promiſed,</hi> and thus, <hi>as a means</hi> to promiſed mercies, we may not only <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> but exerciſe our ſelves in <hi>other duties, ordinances, and appointments</hi> of the Lord Jeſus, as <hi>pray</hi> that we may be <hi>pardoned, juſtiſied, ſaved,</hi> that the Lord would <hi>give us a new heart, and put his ſpirit within us,</hi> &amp;c. though not as conditions giving <hi>right</hi> to ſalvation, for no act of ours lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Lord under an obligation by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to afford theſe to us. All is from meer grace and good pleaſure. But yet, as a man may have purchaſed phyſick that would cure a diſeaſe which he laboureth under, he may have payed for it, and ſo performed <hi>the condition</hi> and hath <hi>right</hi> to it, yet if he doth not <hi>make uſe</hi> of it, he may be uncared: ſo <hi>believers</hi> have <hi>a right</hi> to all even to thoſe that are called <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional promiſes,</hi> they being in Covenant all are theirs, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20.) yet if they do not make uſe of theſe, they may come ſhort of mercies promiſed, not becauſe they fail of a <hi>condition,</hi> but becauſe
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48981:183"/>
they uſe not <hi>the means</hi> to the fruition thereof: like men that have a civil and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute right to great eſtates, and yet are without the comfort thereof, becauſe they make not uſe of them.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>They are of ſome evidencing uſe, who the perſons are, that are intereſted in the promiſes:</hi> though other promiſes are <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,</hi> yet theſe are <hi>ſecondary evidences:</hi> when thoſe gracious qualifications can be diſcerned, they are uſeful for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our intereſt in eternal mercies. They give a deſcription of the perſons, and are ſo far diſtinguiſhing, as when they are ſeen we may meaſure our eſtates and conditions by them.</p>
               <p>Thus, many ſcriptures ſpeak of thoſe <hi>qualifications, not as conditions, giving right,</hi> but as <hi>declarative evidences</hi> of a title to Covenant bleſſings, even to ſalvation. So Rev. 22. 14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life.</hi> Not that their <hi>keeping</hi> of them <hi>did give a right and title</hi> unto life, for none can duly keep them before belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and then they have it; but that their <hi>right</hi> to it may be <hi>evidenced</hi> by ſuch good effects. For, theſe were already in a ſtate of grace, and were before intereſted in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt unto eternal life, on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48981:184"/>
they are oppoſed to thoſe that are <hi>without,</hi> verſ. 15. <hi>without are dogs,</hi> &amp;c. The uſe of <hi>the tree of life,</hi> was the <hi>confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 22, 23. So, this keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Commandments (of which <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> is chief) is the way to <hi>a confirmation</hi> in a living ſtate, or to give a further teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their right to life.</p>
               <p>So Jam. 2. 24. <hi>By works a man is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and not by faith only.</hi> Not that <hi>love or evangelical works</hi> come in the leaſt into <hi>juſtification</hi> it ſelf, as a <hi>cauſe or condition</hi> thereof; the Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians</hi> are full againſt this; but are the fruits and effects of it. They <hi>as evidences,</hi> teſtifie to a mans ſelf, or to others that he is juſtified; as, verſ. 18. <hi>I [will ſhew] thee my faith by my works.</hi> We are then, <hi>not properly,</hi> but only <hi>declaratively</hi> juſtified by works; they as precious effects do argue a lively ſaith which is a means unto imputed righteouſneſs and juſtification, not a ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that it is a condition thereof.</p>
               <p>So, 1 John 1. 9. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi> Not that our <hi>confeſſion</hi> is properly <hi>a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ingaging the faithfulneſs and juſtice of God to forgive, (I proved before, that is not ſuſpended till our confeſſing) but <hi>a
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:48981:184"/>
way and means</hi> to our gaining a ſenſe, a freſh application; an evidence and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of our intereſt in forgiving grace.</p>
               <p>And <hi>as evidences,</hi> ſo they may promote comfort; only we are to take heed, that we do not ground and bottom our conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, on the qualifications within, but on the promiſe it ſelf (or the Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) without. Many are drawing and fetching their comfort from their faith and other graces, and lay the ſtreſs of it there, and accordingly are up and down, eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing therein, in ſtead of fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from the Lord in the promiſe, an immutable thing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. by the means of faith, and taking that and other graces only <hi>as evidences</hi> of intereſt in it. Some, becauſe they are <hi>weary and heavy laden,</hi> thence take their <hi>reſt and refreſhment,</hi> whereas they are called out of themſelves, to <hi>come</hi> for it to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. When qualifications lie moſt dark, or are moſt clearly diſcerned, yet we ſhould not look ſo much to theſe, as to Jeſus Chriſt in the promiſe for Conſolation.</p>
               <p>Thus I have endeavoured to open the <hi>nature of the Old and New Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Mediatorial Office</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, it is largely handled by others, and ſo ſhall not be inſiſted upon by me at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48981:185"/>
Only I would ſay thus much, when Jeſus Chriſt was upon Earth, he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Office of <hi>a Mediator</hi> as to ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and now he is in Heaven, he doth it ſtill as to interceſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. He preſenteth his obedience continually to the Father for our obtainment of what he hath purchaſed. Would we have any ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral bleſſings, <hi>thè Law</hi> written in our <hi>heart</hi> in more lively characters, the Lord witneſſed more fully to be <hi>our God,</hi> or <hi>ſin to be pardoned?</hi> let our faith be acting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as one that mediateth for our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of all; for he is the <hi>Mediator,</hi> not of the <hi>Old, but of the New and Better Teſtament, which is eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes.</hi>
